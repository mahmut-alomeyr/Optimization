i was put off at first by the green powder but it is not that bad there is a little of a grainy texture in the smoothie and it is a tad nutty but not a strong nut flavor i use a non dairy blue almond vanilla milk around oz bananas strawberries crushed icecubes and a couple scoops and blend it in the blender it is not that bad and if color is an issue and you have to have everything a pretty color than natural is not the road to go ,1
these ginger chews are too good to be true i try to limit myself to one a day or i could probably eat the whole box if you love the taste of peanuts and ginger there is no finer treat out there ,1
i love salt and use a variety of salts to keep my blood pressure up in the normal range this salt i think may be the same as that sold by david wolfe is longevitywarehouse but you get twice as much for roughly the same price not only are the descriptions similar but comparing the salts side by side they have the exact same color flavor texture grind fragrance etc in my opinion himalayan salt is definitely much cleaner than sea salt ever since the fukushima plant began leaking radiation into the pacific ocean last year if not before many people are unaware of this because the major television stations are not broadcasting information that would incriminate their owners but just google or youtube search if you want to know what is happening and what your government is not doing about it i definitely recommend boycotting major media and getting your news from alternative sources like enenews which covers what university professors and doctors say is the real truth if the sea salt was not harvested before fukushima started dumping nuclear waste it is just too risky to ingest this salt is from the himalayas which may be just as far from fukushima is dumping ground as you can get ,1
if asked to sum up this coffee pod drawer in one word sturdy would be my enthusiastic answer it is one hefty piece of metal sliding drawer perfection it weighed in at lbs oz on my postal scale the drawers slide in and out with barely a hitch large rubber feet on the bottom means it stays put on your counter the drawers have stops on the bottom so you will not accidentally pull them out completely and best of all k cups fit in perfectly nestling cozily in individual rows per drawer thanks to divider bars in each seriously you can not go wrong with this product if you have only a couple of boxes of k cups you need to store so much more attractive than boxes i do plan to eventually paint mine with metal spray paint to complement my kitchen is color scheme ,1
so far my dog has tried the chicken and peanut butter flavor and she absolutely loves them i love that they are natural and it makes me happy that i am giving my dog something healthy the treats themselves are small and soft a big plus is that they are only calories each ,1

 men is health magazine has been heralding nutritious foods for men of different ages for some time now almonds have conspicuously been high on their lists along with merlot wine and dark chocolate as a flavorful food high on the chart for heart health while i have implemented almonds in my diet for quite some time now i could not help but notice emerald is cocoa roast almonds are fresher and tastier than the bulk almonds i get at the grocery store with a hint of dark chocolate yet retaining a nutty roasted base these savory little nuggets make a good light snack high in vitamin e iron and calcium and having mostly good lipids fats almonds are a delicious way to keep a balanced diet do not expect cocoa roast almonds to be a total confection like chocolate covered raisins with only calories per ounce a little bit goes a long way having only the best ingredients these almonds are a great reward for all hard working people on the go with four canisters per order and oz each you can reward yourself nutritiously for an entire month nutrition is taste is value is overall stars ,1
i am very pleased with this product it is sooooooooooo huge i will not have to purchase this product for while thank you again rhonda m britton smile ,1
i recently ordered some shells in order to cook escargot from another website the frenchy bee poor quality alot of broken shells so i decided to order from this place since the reviews were much better i must say these are a better quality shell thicker than the previous ones and very few shells were chipped out of shells i had broken one chipped and that were non existent it only came with a total of shells it is a simple counting error i honestly would buy from them again because the quality was very good much better from the french bee they were a very very good price too ,1
i have used this flour primarily in bread recipes that call for a gluten free flour blend it has worked in a variety of recipes and is a staple in my gluten free baking ,1
i wanted to give these soy crisps more justice than just the stars and ordering them all the time i bought a bag of these sea salt flavor crisps and a bag of bbq crisps about a month ago in a bid to eat more healthy food i have always loved bbq chips especially ruffles and lays k c masterpiece chips but they have got to be killing me slowly right so i busted open the bbq soy crisps and gagged how could this be bbq they tasted like cardboard and i gave them to my friends who will eat anything i begrudgingly opened the sea salt bag and though more palatable i was still disappointed i know i thought you said stars it gets better anyway i had sworn off chips and midday snacking so for two weeks i saw nothing on the counter but genisoy soy crisps i would eat two or three here and there and when i ran out i bought bags of the sea salt flavor again what happened must be akin to rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drive my body forgot what those strong bbq flavored chips were like and i started craving soy crisps i began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars which i had completely missed before apparently because it was not a sweet red crusted overbearing bbq powder i polished the next bags off in three days now i am ordering here on amazon cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to punish my wallet for trying to eat healthy food my advice is this give these soy crisps a chance but do not mix them in with your regular doritos and bbq ruffles or you will think they are awful stop eating for a month the oily bbq chips that have deadened your taste buds for years and reboot your taste buds with these markedly healthier chips you will feel better about snacking ,1
i have a fairly large bird feeder at the front of the porch and while the location is perfect my local nuthatches were dropping a hundred seeds a day beneath the feeder into the garden below i spent hours this summer weeding sprouting seeds and removing molding piles of shells however ater three weeks of using the seed hoop inch i wanted to be sure nearly all the seeds were caught i have not had to weed once what is more the birds have started using it as a second feeding station especially larger birds who found the perches too small on the original feeder excellent product ,1

i got these on an impulse gold box item and i am really glad i did it is really sweet and milk chocolate tasting which normally i would not be into but with these it is quite good the candy cane pieces stick to the spoon you stir it with really badly though i keep packets in my office and one in my purse for when i need a pick me up i recommend this product ,1

gatorade was an acquired taste for me but these days i can not stop drinking it it is full of electrolytes and it does indeed have very few calories especially when you consider how it helps you rehydrate at the same time you can drink this either cold from the refrigerator or warm from the shelf i like it either way and actually when i drink it warm the flavor tastes even better this pack comes in three flavors fruit punch lemon lime and grape the only negative i can think of is that this does have sugar and carbs in it if you have concerns about sugar in your diet you should talk to your physician before drinking this highly recommended ,1
this mustard has been a long time favorite of my family to me this mustard is all about ballpark hot dogs and pretzels it has good flavor and in our area it is just too hard to find in the grocery stores ,1
i like anchiovy a lot my husband and inlaws are spaniards who loves to eat anchiovy with bread pizza and salad and i like to make really good ceasar salad but in order to make a great dressing you have to have the best ingredients my number prefernce for anchiovy are from italy but i have to go to the italian store in a different city to get it and i have a back injury which stops me from driving around too much so i asked my friend from new jersey to bring me anchiovy the new york pizza shop uses in jersey she brought cento amd rolands both have a mild sweeter flavor and aroma and less salty these are close to the italian anchiovy that i prefer rolands is not sold in smaller tins you see once you open the anchiovy in the big tim you have to put the rest it in a glass container with lots of olive oil and vacuum it or else it will change in flavor and spoil faster well i dont have a vacuum container so i chose cento instead it comes in small tin and its from morocco i am glad amazon sells it and i love the subscription so i dont have to worry about running out ,1
this is a great and attentive company attends to your emails and concerns however this particular fish is somewhat dry for king salmon it is supposed to be oily this is not the fish comes in a pouch more like canned tuna it is just ok but i would not purchase this again for the price very similar to chicken of the sea tuna ,0
recently could not find this and bought kal brand instead sweet leaf tastes the best i do not do artificial flavors so i have only tried the clear love it in my coffee ,1
i have used this in protein shakes and on sandwiches for years its an amazing alternative to peanutbutter to save calories without sacrificing taste,1
these beans arrived promptly and as others have said were plump and have a nice aroma the price was so reasonable that it encouraged me to try them in many different ways so far i have made a batch of kahlua a batch of vanilla extract and a batch of homemade granola using these beans and still have left i am going to chop a bean up finely and add it to the heated milk i use for homemade yogurt i am guessing that will be yummy very pleased with this purchase the quality is superb for those having storage issues the proper way to store vanilla beans is to wrap each vanilla bean separately in plastic wrap expelling all the air and then put all the wrapped beans in a plastic bag also expelling all the air and store in your pantry or other dark cool location every month take the beans out unwrap them let them air for minutes or so then wrap back up and store i have never had one go bad doing this ,1
pork chops can be intimidating your classic chop is a very lean piece of meat that can dry out very quickly especially if you are concerned about ensuring that the meat is well done because after all it is pork there are a couple ways around this problem one is to substitute a less lean cut of pork the less lean pork is far less expensive and has more flavor on it is own but it is also fairly fatty another way is to plan ahead and soak your chops in a seasoned brine over night a third way is to bread your chops and that is where shake n bake comes in now first off i advise strongly not to use this product with shoulder steaks or blade steaks use rib chops the shake n bake mix includes fat to keep the breading from sticking to the pan so it works best with very lean pork second do not oil or grease your pan do you need to shake in a bag well you could just dredge but when you shake in a bag you get all the sides coated not just the big sides i was able to coat four rib chops and had some coating left resist the urge to sprinkle it on the already breaded chops it will not bake properly if you do that if you disregarded my advice and bought pork blade steaks instead of chops you are probably not going to have enough breading for more than three as the blade steaks generally have more surface area than a rib chop does as for flavor this is a very traditional flavor much as i remembered from my youth it is quite obvious that we are talking about a cornmeal based breading with mild flavors such as onion and celery powder and only a hint of pepper if you like a little more bite you can add a couple extra shakes of black pepper to the mix if you want to make breaded pork chops from scratch you certainly can get some cornmeal and some seasonings do not forget to grease your pan if you do it yourself but you know what buying cornmeal and spices in bulk is not less expensive if you are not going to use them up before they loose their freshness shake n bake comes sealed in one meal sized packages and even if you want to adjust the seasoning it starts out from a nice baseline personally i like my pork chops grilled broiled is another good way but like i said earlier pork is very lean and it is easy to ruin it so if you are looking to get more lean pork into your diet the easy way is to go with breaded pork chops and shake n bake is the easiest way to do that but remember get rib chops do not substitute pork blade steaks for breaded pork chops that is the fast track to a meal that only gets or stars ,1
we have been buying these floppy discs for our australian shepard since he was months old he is now years old and going strong our only complaints are the price very expensive for a toy that does not hold up to normal dog use i buy them by the half dozen and have to replace them every year since he gets daily floppy disc time ,1
two jars of barlean is organic coconut oil arrived on time and in excellent condition with a sale date in all seals external and internal were intact upon opening no suspicious odor of any kind was noticed only a light coconut smell meets the nose however the oil currently well solid does not have a uniform appearance in places that might be due to proximity to the black jar in other places however swirls of oil seem denser or grayer or perhaps not as gelled any frequent user could tell me whether this is common with this product a call to the manufacturer is representative said comment could not be made unless the contents were seen and that i might easily return the jars to amazon which i would rather not do if it is able to be used thanks ,1
these were bought for a friend who used to get them all the time when he lived in california but hasnt been able to find them in the east he was thrilled to receive them and we enjoyed them as soon as they were chilled over pound cake and vanilla ice cream yummy and just last week he said he want to order another case ,1
i do not mind subtle but i thought outside of peppery on the back of the throat it seems quite tasteless i imagine some like it this way but i would like more green and olivevy ,0
this is a mild flavored and smooth textured brown rice it cooks up only slightly sticky so can be used in western dishes easily it is perfect for feeding to family members with a preference for white rice ,1
while i have liked the other products in this line using this was a disaster my scalp has been itchy with signs of dandruff and i thought since the other products were so helpful this would be good as well yikes for starters there are no directions on the jar so what to do it is very greasy but i took a handful and rubbed it into my scalp and massaged so far so good i left it on my scalp for the rest of the evening to give it a chance to work the horror started when i tried to wash it out after shampooing it three times i gave up and just let it dry the next morning i was a mass of greasy looking curls i will be washing my hair every day until i get rid of this but i certainly will not try it again ,0
ordered dozen red roses and was assured delivery by february not only did the roses never arrive but i have yet to recieve any replies to my enquieries horrible horrible service ,0

i purchased these for my husbands candy bin in his office at work in case you wonder how many fireballs are in oz like i did there are fireballs in this bag i debated on purchasing this bag or the ct container and went with this size for easy transportation as we live overseas and i will pack these in my suitcase the price comparison is negligible with this bag being slightly cheaper these are very difficult to find in stores i searched costco super walmart smart final with no luck till i decided to just check and see if amazon carries them bingo ca not go wrong with amazon ,1
this product was fresh and was shipped very quickly it is so hard to find candy from my childhood in the stores anymore a vendor put them in our vending machine at work last year since then i have asked for them everytime i see them no luck so thank you very much for having such a great childhood memory sincerly jamie w kitty hawk nc,1
i love this coffee and got a good price on it shipping was very quick and easy i do not like the dark blends of coffee so i got the breakfast blend it is a medium blend will be buying more ,1
this has been a good substitute for wheat flour in quick breads like biscuits it helps to add some xanthum gum with it though because it can be a little crumbly ,1
i decided to try oil pulling and selected this coconut oil to try with i will say i am not sure if i buy into the whole coconut oil pulling thing but anything is worth a shot i found that it is best for me to put a glob of the oil under my tounge to melt just sticking a glob in my mouth on top of my tounge made me want to barf after it melts under my tounge i can swish it and the taste is very subtle it almost feels like i am just swishing saliva around i also decided to start incorporating this oil into my morning cup of coffee as i have seen other reviews mention it does not really add any taste but is an easy way to get this in my body also moisturizes my lips as i drink it yum i have not tried any other coconut oils but this seems to fit the bill no complaints ,1
buy this stuff all the time but i am not sure why anyone buys it off amazon because it is a box here and its a box at walmart ,1
i want to begin by saying that i am no cacao expert this is the first time i have tried it i wanted to try it for three reasons a trusted friend suggested it am always looking for healthy snacks to fill my day i am on the go constantly is supposed health benefits i am not saying it does or does not have them just alluding to the fact that i am no health nutritional expert so here is what i think these are going to be an acquired taste like beer actually they very much remind me of a red wine a burgundy maybe the bag even smells like wine when you open it up they are very tiny pieces they are very crunchy if you have teeth that are very sensitive i would think twice about getting these upon tasting them on the front of the palate it tasted very much like a red wine then slightly bitter and moving to the back of the palate it tasted very earthy and you got the flavor of cocoa powder then swallow you are going to want something to rinse it down it is a little grainy at that point i like the texture and i like the taste but then again i like wine i have mixed it into yogurt and i find it rather good you get less of the wine bitter flavors and more of the earthy and traditional cocoa powder flavors i use honey flavored greek yogurt i also eat them plain as little nibbles they do not bother me that way either a little wake me up if the flavor really offends you but you want the health benefits you can order organic sugar cacao nibs do an internet search they are tossed with organic cane syrup i will try those for a treat soon that is all i got cheers ,1
i really like this chocolate at it contains just a touch more cocao than most mid range milk chocolate bars because of that it is a little more bitter and a little stronger chocolate flavor but still creamy enough and sweet enough to be milk chocolate it has a nice snap when you break a cool bar and it takes a moment to warm up enough to start melting on your tongue when i eat good chocolate i let the first bite dissolve on my tongue to better appreciate the scent flavor and smoothness of it this one is very smooth it has a touch of lecithin which helps make for a smoother chocolate the rest of the ingredients are cocao milk sugar cocoa butter and vanilla the flavor is very nicely chocolate the wrapper says that there is a caramel flavor to it but for me it tasted more toasty with a rich liqueur finish the vanilla was barely noticeable but it did serve nicely as balance it makes for a bar that is rich without being too rich and it is just a touch bitter like a good semi sweet chocolate i gave a piece to my dad who really seems to think chocolate is a food group and he was less enthused he likes it well enough but thought it was just a little too bitter and prefers the lower cocoa higher milk and sugar bars made by other chocolatiers he said it is good not great but good ,1
i ate the last bowl today of whole grain kashi and the last shake of the box which had an experation date of october exposed the insect not sure what kind of bug it was but i know its not whole grain anything ,0

i had received my venus fly traps a few days ago and could not review immediately after i got them because i had to go to a camp with my family when i opened the box i had received venus fly traps instead of they were all healthy and of them was pretty big i was emailed before i had received the vft and on the day i did i recommend this seller and will be sure to order more from them in the future i will upload a photo later and update this review ,1
i have been using this seasoning for years now and it is my go to seasoning like the other reviewer said it complements all meats and fish it also excellent for cooked greens but my favorite is to use it for making homemade salad dressing instead of buying over priced salad seasoning packs or premade dressings i too appreciate that it has no msg and it has no artificial ingredients thanks for keeping it real konriko ,1

this is a great tasting tea but has no nutritional value no matter it is palatable without sweetners and a treat with sugar hot cold half strength or double a variety of flavor experiences in the same box the mesh pryamid shaped bags make it brew up fast too just add hot water i have drank other lipton products including some of their other herbal teas it is a break from the run of the mill routine coffee and caffine free too the vanilla adds something to the blackberry base and the rose hips flavor it somewhat but i would not know hibiscus if it bit me i did not recognize the black current and raspberry flavors i am no gourmet all i can tell you is that i like this brew the remainder of this box will be very welcome on cold graveyard shifts i plan to add this tea to my shopping list the next time i am in the supermarket ,1
these are wonderful but you can get them at costco for jar but be careful as i truly believe they are addictive ,1

as a repeat customer to the peppermint and other amoretti products i am very impressed with the quality and customer service ,1
without question the best readily available canned tuna in olive oil for the price once you have eaten tuna in olive oil you will never to back to the wretched catfood that is referred to as tuna packed in water it is good enough to eat out of the can and great with capers and chopped onion on a salad btw those posters who complain that that genova was at one time italian sourced tuna are misinformed genova is simply the trade name used by chicken of the sea for its yellowfin tuna packed in olive oil packing in olive oil is the traditional method of preservation for mediterranean caught tuna it was once canned in american samoa but is now processed in thailand it has never been italian sourced ,1
this is the real deal not some watered down ghost pepper sauce found at local farmer is market i love spicy food and add a few drops to my own sauces salsas to bring them up to a level that most people have never experienced its become somewhat of an addiction for myself and i love the stuff however you may want to give clear warning to guests if your serving it up at a friends and family get together otherwise you may not have anymore friends or family a bottle of this stuff should last a year or two as just a dab will do ,1
i used to spend a fortune on good chai tea at the coffee shop then i discovered the double spice tea we both loved the stronger flavor of the spices to my dismay on my next trip to the grocery store the double spice tea was nowhere to be found it was one of those items that apparently was not on their regular ordering schedule i looked it up on amazon and there it was six boxes at a time on subscribe and save a decent price and quick delivery this tea is great with a sweetener of choice i generally use stevia or agave in mine and some milk or cream hot or cold my hubbie drinks it with no additions at all and it is his pre sleep tea of choice i have also used bags in my iced tea maker and the result is yummy iced tea or add just a bag of this tea to regular tea for a hint of spice stash teas are great overall i like the fact that they are individually wrapped in a foil wrap that holds together well and can be taken to the office or wherever without dissolving in one is pocket or purse it is black tea and contains caffeine if this is a problem try the good earth original caffeine free tea also available on amazaon it is a delicious slightly sweet cinnamon y tea ,1
a good shampoo that cleans and protects your hair at the same time i recommend this shampoo and it is companion conditioner good products for hair care i rate clear scalp hair beauty total care nourishing shampoo fluid stars ,1
other reviews said the packaging was inadequate broken or not air tight that was not my experience arrived in good condition i checked every bottle for a proper seal the sauce is very good compared to store brands and the price is reasonable considering the quality ,1
if you are cooking for two i suggest using only half of the coconut and curry sauce packets the biggest headache was trying to figure out what the heck is half of a cup of water clearly the instructions are british in terms of measurements i guessed that halving it amounts to just under a cup of water as for meat i had a nearly lb package of beef i did not want to end up with too much sauce and not enough meat which some reviewers here seemed to have gotten stuck with if you want to make sure the coconut powder melts make sure your saucepan is very hot i did this by first stir frying some vegetables onions mushrooms whatever using a non stick cooking spray less fat then used that same pan to fry the meat this time adding veggie oil once the meat was almost done i put it aside and the poured the coconut and water together since the pan was already very hot from frying the meat and the veggies the coconut powder melted easily with the water no grains left whatsoever i added the paste and it did not take long to boil then i poured the veggies and meat into the sauce and mixed it up together tip some reviewers have commented that the paste sticks to the inside of the foil packet for the stuck paste i used a narrow silicone spatula the kind you use for frosting cakes it removed a lot of it easily and cleanly the rice was done and so i just added it all together it was not as spicy as i hoped it would be which i fear may be due to my adding too much water still it had lots of complex flavors in it the package says to use any leftover sauce packets within days so i look forward to making another meal out of it pretty soon either way the taste was very pleasing and i would buy it again ,1
this is a chips ahoy flavor called ooey gooey chocofudge so it should already be pretty clear from the get go who is going to love this and who is not the cookies are soft but do not fall apart or dissolve in your mouth they are definitely gooey but not overly messy obviously they are not going to beat homemade fudge cookies fresh out of the oven but for a packaged treat in the goodie aisle of the supermarket these are pretty tasty and well worth the purchase add a little milk and you are in for a seriously good time ,1
i use this as a hot oil treatment before i shampoo my hair it is awesome it is make my hair soft strong and shiny i place tsp in a bowl then place the bowl in hot water to heat it up then i apply it to my hair afterwards i cover with a plastic cap and satin scarf bonnet for hrs rinse then shampoo i also add it to my deep conditioners and use it to seal in my moisturizers daily,1
this is a wonderful full bodied tea i will never buy teabags again but having been a teabag drinker all my life i did not realize how diluted it was until i tried loose tea i would recommend using much less tea than their instructions say i make it in a coffee maker which i use exclusively for tea and use teaspoons blended with a teaspoon of blackcurrant tea per cups following their instructions resulted in a tea that was bitter experiment till you find the proportions that suit you it is well worth the experimentation i drink as iced tea and when drinking hot cream perfectly complements it ,1
i purchased the peanut butter co peanut butter white chocolate wonderful jars pack of by peanut butter co directly from amazon in july the expiration date stated jan which is plenty of time to go through jars of this tasty peanut butter the listed ingredients are as follows peanuts evaporated cane juice vanilla cocoa butter palm fruit oil lecithin from sunflowers salt the packaging also states that it is gluten free and certified vegan this product does not require mixing as some of the more natural peanut butters sometimes do while i personally can not discern any white chocolate flavor it is a very enjoyable peanut butter ,1
i really like the taste just a touch of salt but they are more chewy then i would like the gustaf is rounds are a little better ,1
this creamer helped me save my coffee from tasting so off i definately recomend the saver pack it is helped me satify some avid coffee drinkers ,1
i first picked this off the shelf at a military commissary in kansas one summer and i never stopped the first time you try this stuff it is like wine or avocados it is a taste that is certainly acquired and like nothing else i have fed it to a friend and to my significant other few like it the first time but you find yourself strangely coming back for more until it is a staple in your house like it is in mine kind of reminds me of sushi first time i tried it i was like this is odd why do people eat this then i found myself craving it a week later haha now i love sushi and miso by the way it comes in an envelope with individual packets mix it in hot water to taste you might like it with more or less water depending on how salty you like your food experiment with it to your satisfaction and i guarantee there is much of that to be had i usually add all little individual packets it is low fat to a decent sized cup of hot water add my favorite vinegar and let it sit and cure for a minute or so since the little green sea vegetable flakes and green onions tofu squares need time to rehydrate and turn a little chewy and palatable i then sip it and fish the sea vegetables out to my heart is content i also hear that miso can be generally healthy for you if you let it sit the miso will start to separate from the rest of the soup and you have delightful little clouds of miso particles floating in your bowl which is sort of entertaining and visually delightful too i think of it as cheap delicious entertainment but then again i am easily amused ,1
i have purchased a few of the enjoy life faux cookie products and although the price and quantity were hard to digest i thought the taste was more than tolerable i returned the faux granola because it was too hard a bowl of pebbles literally but it may have been on the store shelf too long btw you can not see inside the package or any other enjoy life package for that matter then the perky is rice crunch i purchased and enjoyed for months changed the label had the enjoy life logo on it and ounces less product at a higher price okay the times they are a changin and i moved on last week i purchased the chewy on the go bars sunbutter crunch the taste was good what more do i deserve however it was a marketing triumph four dollars and forty nine cents for diminutive bars at least compared to the packaging the bars are about two thirds the size of the foil wrap they come in add in the dead space in the box and you got what used to be referred to as a rip off in a health food store no one can hear you scream ,0
i wake up craving these bars so delicious not too sweet but enough to satisfy a sweet craving without raising your blood sugars they are great for road trips or hiking or when i am home i refrigerate them which makes them crunchie the goji berry flavor is also divine enjoy ,1
i have been buying farmer is market organic butternut squash at my local supermarket for the past year it was not always available when i shopped there so finding it on amazon com was a great find for me this is probably the best butternut squash i have eaten and it is well worth every penny which by the way comes out to far less pennies at amazon than at my local supermarket ,1
i have tried all the organic dark chocolates out there and green and black is by far the best most consistent bar it is really really good ,1
i am nay used to be known as the master of the perfect s amore that perfect golden brown marshmallow blown up to the size of a baseball ok i will admit toasting a marshmallow to gargantuan proportions is not often possible many factors must be present and the stars must be in alignment i think the most important thing is to use properly stale marshmallows much like searing a piece of meat on the bbq but i digress now giant marshmallows have arrived and s amores will never be the same anyone can make giant toasted marshmallows without years of practice honed skills and intense concentration it just is not fair but i am not bitter i embrace the improvement of the ultimate s amore marshmallow for all to enjoy like prince is oversize tennis racket of the early is and callaway is big bertha drivers of the is campfire has now changed the sport ,1
i do not much care for rice white rice tastes like paste and brown rice tastes like nothing i cook it frequently only because my family loves it this black rice is really good though i add a little olive oil and salt and the result is the best rice i have ever had ,1
worked out perfectly for the candy bar at my wedding great size resealable bag works well arrived perfectly fresh good crowd pleaser ,1
great product i am supplementing this along with breast milk as i continue to nurse and it is the only formula that does not cause my baby to get constipated he used to scream when he pooped and now i have a much happier baby so we are all happier i can not find this in any store so i am so glad that amazon carries this product ,1
i really tried to like these i do not even remember ordering them on line as they are in my local supermarket first you have to get over the fishy smell when you open them even after rinising well they smell and then they are mushy i have tried them several ways and to me i would rather just eat a smaller portion of pasta as these do not satisfy at all ,0
great product at a great price especially with free prime shipping a much better price than anyone locally ,1
i know this is people food and i will use some in cooking but i bought this for repelling some insects in my organic garden cayenne works fine for this and i have never seen it at a better price i have mixed it with diatomaceous earth and sprinkled it on the soil i have also made a pepper tea with a drop of dish soap to help it stick cooled and strained i have used it as a spray ,1
one word classic my husband wont eat any other brand as they dont compare these are perfection in a bag it seems there is less salt than a few years ago which is fantastic but they still taste delish ,1
i give them out as a gift you can not beet them all there candy is the greatest ,1
i just received it friday lbs is a hell of a lot of coffee but worth it at this price with subscribe and save at first i did not like the way it smelled not used to dark roast but it tastes amazing also dark roast has a little less caffeine than a lighter roast like colombian because it is cooked longer fyi this is darn good coffee highly recommended ,1
these are the best bags ever but the company needs to seriously get to work on adding some neutral colors and designs i would buy them for everyone i know but not pink with gold peace signs i have had a set of these bags i got from amazon a long while ago when the maker was still producing other designs mine are black with green leaves on them they are the best reusable bags out there they hold a ton of stuff they will easily hold more than a dozen large dog food cans or three soda bottles you can tie and untie the straps together very easily the straps are long enough to comfortably carry the bags on your shoulder there is a little loop on them so they will hook to the plastic bag rack at the grocery store so they can be filled easily the sewn on velcro straps are fantastic way way better than dealing with fussy little pouches the alternatives come in they roll back up in seconds and the velcro straps hold them into tiny little bundles they are lightweight i carry them with me everywhere i go and use them for all of my shopping they hold up really well and are easy to clean in the washer and dryer i just toss them in with everything else i have washed them over and over and over and they are still strong and in great shape every time i pull them out of my purse everyone comments on them and asks where i got them i always say i got them at amazon but there is something wrong with the manufacturer because they have only had these funky pink peace sign designs available for a really long time if you are not bothered by pink peace signs you will love these bags i also got the little white mesh draw string bags amazon features as the buy together and they are great too i use them for produce and lunch bags ,1
i started my little vizsla on this food a couple months ago and have observed some fantastic results i originally had her on blue buffalo she did not care for the food at all which resulted in me adding wet food and other temptations to coax her to eat since switching to this brand i have have not had to tempt her to eat one time she loves this dog food her coat is super shiny and there is a noteable difference in her stools you can not beat the quality price of this brand i think the name is incredibly embarrasing but i am quick to recommend this brand to anyone that asks ,1
i got addicted to this stuff when i was living in japan and one of my big regrets about being back in the us is how hard and how expensive it is to lay my hands on some yuzu kosho yuzu kosho is made from the citrus fruit yuzu which has a distinct flavor different from a lime or lemon kosho basically means pepper and this paste has a peppery flavor with a distinct yuzu bite it is soooooo good and goes with almost everything it is especially good on chicken and fish which is what i mainly use it for i also use it for a ranch style dressing that is fantastic this brand here is a high quality version rather than the ubiquitous cheap tube form you can find anywhere in japan you do not use a lot of it when cooking and a little goes a long ways so this little jar will last awhile i am really glad to have a place to buy it here in the us because frankly i do not want to go back to cooking without it ,1
this is the only nacho cheese dip i will eat it is not too spicy but it does have a bite and it is very cheesy it is so addicting problem amazon has not carried it in over a year will you pleeze sell my cheese i can not find it anywhere ,1
my friend was deployed to iraq a couple of months ago when i asked him if he had any special requests for his care package he asked me to send him corn nuts they will not melt in the heat and the smaller bags travel well so they are a great portable snack the quantity should hold him for a while and allow him to share with his friends he was very happy ,1
this bag is way too small for larger dogs my yellow lab weighs approximately pounds i wish they indicated what size dog these bags were for although the bag is usable i would not recommend it for a larger dog ,0
i drink this to help keep my supply up now that my old feeds less regularly since he started on solids this is a pretty good price when purchased in pk and was shipped quickly ,1
wow i am so suprised i have tried a few differant kinds of gf breads because my husband can not eat gluten i being a bread eater found almost all that i tried to be un ediable and uterly repulsive but this bread was good so good in fact i went and dubble checked to see if it was gf because i thaught i might have mistakenly ordered the wrong thing then now this is the really supriseing part i went back for more i had two slices of thoast it smells like bread feels like bread maybe just a little gain y and taste just like bread i can not wait for my husband to try it ,1
i have been purchasing artic paws products for years i use to order direct from the company in alaska thankfully now it is easier to order yummy chummies they have the best treats for dogs ,1
for me kettle is the best brand on the market they really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods i did not think anything could top their salt and pepper chips but these are my new favorite the flavors are pure and real they go great with just about everything and are highly addictive i hope they come out with a low fat version their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors ,1
i remember having this all the time as a kid in the u k we would put a tea spoon amount of strawberry or mixed berry jam in and stir so l tried it the other day and was transported back to being a kid again it is so smooth and creamy and filling i miss not having certain comfort foods but i am glad l can find them on amazon it took a few weeks to get my rice pudding but that is ok l will be back for more ,1
we have totally indoor cats we had been told by their vet to buy the expensive dry food which he happened to carry the cats were not handling it very well and the expense got to be too much after reading the ingredients list here at amazon com we decided to try it the cats had had some problems with throwing up their dry food since we have changed to the blue buffalo we have seen a marked decrease in these incidents the other plus is that the blue buffalo is delivered right to our door no more lugging that heavy bag of dry food from the vet into the car and then into the house we have tried both the chicken and brown rice and the salmon and rice and have found that our cats tolerate the chicken better ,1
summary a very good starter gourmet dark chocolate for those who are not into strong flavors we eat a disturbing amount of chocolate around our house whether it is lindt ghiradelli sees cadbury toblerone scharffen berger godiva or even hershey is we have had it we tend towards the very dark chocolates although i do have to say we had some lindt in the range which was just a bit too sharp i am also a espresso aficionado this chocolate has a very smooth texture it is well tempered and starts out quite firm in the mouth then melts to a very smooth consistency it is fairly sweet for a dark chocolate not as sweet as a hershey is special dark but more than other dark chocolates in this range cocoa gives a much stronger taste than milk chocolate and here it still has a very creamy finish with no sharp aftertaste still i found it simply chocolate without any accompanying flavors you tend to notice in the stronger chocolates if you like your coffee black or like cappuccinos then this might be for you if you drink turkish coffee or espresso then this probably will not have enough punch for you ,1
i have not tried this popcorn it is actually for a deployed marine however i looked at the package and laughed when i opened it i had been dollars for package of popcorn seller your picture is very deceiving ,0
dont we just love this gluten free pancake mix we tired it first by buying a single packet from the store and tried this with a couple of other brands found in wholefoods hands down this flour mix was by far the best and why we loved it the mixture forms beautifully on the griddle good circular shape not runny consistency even when you follow the instructions had a nice buttery taste no butter added we added a tablespoon of flax mix with the cup of flour and that only further enhanced the flavor and goodness cooked evenly and was easy to flip to cook other sidethese may seems like obvious points but some other larger gf brand really didnt meet the standard actually this tsate a whole heap better than using either plain white or whole wheat flour i would recommend this brand for gf or non gf we will be recommending this to family and friends gf or no gf ,1
we love these crackers for our salmon spread they have just the right flavor and crispness to enjoy the taste of the spread and they are healthy ,1
quick delivery good price love it so glad i got it and its great to have variety packs to buy so you do not buy a huge box of a new flavor and end up not liking it you can try multiple flavors until you find the ones you love very happy ,1
arm hammer is baking soda is aluminum free they just do not write it on their packaging i was not sure so i called them and they said there is no aluminum in it and they would have to state it if there was because people take the product internally this leads me to believe that there just is not aluminum in baking soda and researching it showed me that there might have been in the past but not anymore and not for a long time i resent that bob is red mill writes aluminum free on their package and then charges a premium for their product it is also arsenic free i hope if they label it arsenic free will we assume other brands are not i do not like that kind of marketing ,0
this new enhanced splenda has calories per packet and provides of the recommended daily intake of vitamins and based on a calorie diet i have been using regular splenda both loose and in packets for several years i do not notice any aftertaste unlike the lingering taste of sweet n low which i can not stomach i did taste tests with splenda splenda essentials with b vitamins and splenda essentials with antioxidants i tried all three with berries tea and greek yogurt i could not distinguish the difference between the three as far as taste or level of sweetness they all dissolved easily in hot tea and mixed into the yogurt without any graininess as other reviewers have noted the packaging for splenda essentials with b vitamins and splenda essentials with antioxidants is different than the regular splenda packets the enhanced splenda products come in foil lined packets while the regular splenda comes in paper packets similar to equal and sweet n low i would have liked to have seen information on the box about any potential side effects of consuming too much vitamin b per day i suggest speaking with a doctor about whether vitamin b interacts with any medication you may take and whether there are any concerns with taking too much on a daily basis i drink at least cups of tea per day and am not comfortable taking of the recommended daily intake of vitamins and especially since i also take a multivitamin daily i plan to rely mainly on the regular non enhanced splenda especially since it is significantly less expensive than either of the enhanced versions ,1
this product is not a toy it is a real energy drink with the imfamis title romulan ale it tastes great and was rare gift i could present to a fellow trekker ,0
the k cup carousel is a great item to store your k cups in so you can see the flavors you have but i did find something better at bed bath and beyond it is a k cup drawer it holds cups as the carousel does beings it is made out of medal you can stack the drawer plus you can put your drawers right under your coffee machine ,1
my year old gets so excited when i give him one of these you would think it was candy travels extremely well has never made a mess he sucks them down to fast for that organic fruits are the only ingredients what is not to love i have tried them and yum these grape ones are his favorite but he also loves the berry tropical and the red one by ella is kitchen these are the greatest idea in kids snacks ever when they are older i will put these in their school lunches what a great way to add fruits to diets kids or otherwise try these ,1
for a person who loves but cannot drink coffee teeccino almost replaces my true love the chocolate teeccino is as good as desert it is very flavorabe and rich ,1

i was initially scared to try this noodle because it was brownish then i felt silly because a whole wheat pasta is brown and b i eat seaweed all the time at japanese restaurants well these noodles are no different than jfc is white yam noodles outside of the fact that they are healthier because of the addition of seaweed the texture is really strong and firm and they are not too chewy i microwave for minutes prior to cooking in sauce or soup i did not smell any suspension liquid during rinsing though it might be habit not to take any breaths before they are rinsed this is a great buy and went really great with my minty pesto mahi mahi tonight ,1
i found this product to be quite delicious in reading the ingredients it appears to be all natural which is a plus for anyone interested in a healthy alternative to cokes and other less natural alternatives it is mildly carbonated but not fizzy just a touch of bubbly that really struck a nice balance for me i would recommend this to anyone ,1
this is seriously the best chocolate milk i have ever tried it tastes different than most milk in a way i can not really describe but it is delicious however i would have to agree with the people that say this price is crazy watch for them to go on sale at the grocery stores the krogers around here offer them individually packaged for a dollar per box ,1
wonderful healthy dog treats that my dog absolutely loves and she is a very picky eater these things smell delicious when you open the box and they are made with only natural ingredients and of course are made in the us ,1
came over to the house and ate many of these wheels he has always complained that he can not find licorice like he had as a kid well now he has found it everyone in the house loved these wheels and the bag barely lasted a week ca not beat the price through amazon either especially when they offer it at off we stock up on these and the gold bears ,1

i bought this because i wanted to change things up a bit with desserts and thought that i would make fruit and dessert sushi i read many reviews that said it did not have a taste or the taste was minimal so i bought it but when i tried it i found the taste to be a little overpowering aside from that it was very easy to use and it does look pretty i guess i will have to really flavor up the other ingredients so i can wash out the taste in the wrappers ,1
i first discovered hint water while traveling out of state i like flavored water but not those containing artificial sweeteners hint has just a delicate fruity taste and no sugar or other sweeteners it is very refreshing and i find i drink more water when i have hint water on hand i love the variety of flavors my favortie is strawberry kiwi i like this water so much that i have it on amazon is subscribe and save delivered to my home monthly my only complaint is that it is a bit pricey and so i only order bottles month i would love to have twice that much anyway great stuff ,1
very good product flavors are robust and as expected make sure you keep the cap on tight to prevent loss of quality ,1
has a unique flavor that i have grown to love and eat it with everything yogurt or in salads and sometimes blend it into smoothies perfect for people resistance training and eating in between meals to keep a good protein supplement continuous throughout the day ,1
i have never liked starbucks coffee this in spite of loving the chain nantucket nectars the cakes and the warm atmosphere are all a plus but the coffee has always been horrible there have been two main issues i have had with starbucks brand the coffee was not robust and the bitter aftertaste lasted far longer than i would like even venturing back for a cup at different locations and at different times left me wanting something more desirable however this blend of vanilla and light medium acacia and sarsaparilla beans is quite good there is still a slight bitter after taste but overall it is flavorful and has a nice veneer of vanilla that does not dominate i e that you are not drinking vanilla quik and not so weak that you have forgotten that it was an ingredient better than average but not stars,1
this is both a blessing and a curse the blessing part is these pill pockets are pretty much perfect they take a pill very nicely cover it and make it wonderfully desirable for the dog to eat the pills serve with food because it is so bitter your dog will hate you forever is not a match for these little suckers little dog loves these and would happily snarf down the entire packet if she could as for the curse well you can no longer safely move pill containers anywhere with a keen ear and a taste for beef pill pockets your dog will hear you shift your containers even one nanometer and come running expecting you to give it a treat my dad has to take pills twice daily you can see why this is an issue sealed air tight for freshness approximately to a bag suitable for small pills tasty yet functional a fantastic delivery system for an otherwise annoying problem stars ,1
i received these recently as a gift because we got a keurig for christmas and i do not really drink coffee these are amazing the apple aroma is very strong and the taste is just as great i am enjoying a cup as i type this ,1

i just returned from italy where i bought a balconi tiramisu cake in a grocery store i had the cake for three weeks before i brought it home to eat i kept thinking how is it possible this cake will be any good when it has not been refrigerated i bought it off the shelf in the cookie isle in italy the cake was wonderful it is extremely tasty and moist i highly recommend this great quick dessert ,1
this is not an everyday dessert it is very good rivaling what you get at a restaurant the only trouble i have is getting it to come cleanly out of the ramekin pans i think the trick is contrary to the directions is to wait a couple of minutes prior to taking it out you could also buy a piece pan ,1
i was hoping for something that tasted similar to a w diet cream soda this was not even close not sure what it tastes like but i did not like it i have not liked all the sodastream flavors i have tried but this is the first i actually disliked a friend of mine tried it the same attempt and she did like it so it takes all kinds ,0
this is a re order and a must have on the shelf ready to make especially in cold weather the only wish is that it had less salt since i must restrict my salt intake but the salt is not too bad in this one and by adding more potatoes etc it can be reduced per serving ,1
i have tried most of the baked potato chips made by popchips so i figured i would give these a try they are delicious these tortilla chips are just as good if not better than their non healthy counterparts the ranch tortilla chips are my favorite so far but the chili limon and nacho cheese are very good as well i highly recommend trying these tortilla chips ,1
these are great noodles however the same product is made in both korea and california the two versions have very different ingredients the korean version is vegetarian while this one from california is not ,1
i have been a fan of metromint since i first tried,1
this is the worst tasting protein i have ever eaten it is the indiana jones and the crystal skull of the protein world ,0
i have been making yogurt using the yogourmet machine and this cba starter since it was very easy to make successful yogurt consistently so i never switched to any other products it is good for both non fat and whole fat milk although personally i prefer whole fat since it tastes original i use to of a small bag for each gallon container of yogurt it always comes out right after hours of cooking time i will definitely recommend this product ,1
i have used another much more expensive powder that my dog would not eat once on her food this stuff obviously smells and tastes good to her because she eats it it is a natural salmon flavor but does not stink my dog has hip dysplasia and her vet recommended she take stuff with glucoseamine in it like this powder i like how it is made in the u s a since she likes it i will keep buying it i have not gone through the whole container but she is pounds and i use tablespoons a day so i do not know how long it will last ,1
lets be honest i do not care about it being organic buy these things with subscribe and save through amazon mom i am a dad where is amazon dad amazon anywho all i care is that they do not pump these full of extra sugar sweeteners which is not necessary since this stuff has naturally high levels of sugar anyway i do like that it has veggies in it and carrot puree is on the ingredient list rather than just veggie juice my daughter can down several packets in a row if i let her months old she loves this stuff regardless of the brand so we try to mix in the variety of ingredients where we can ,1
i am gluten intolerant and low and behold it had wheat in it so i gave it someone who could use it ,0
i bought and used this product and it was satisfactory in every sense except that when i went back to buy more the copy said ground in a frozen state to preserve the shape of the flakes did not go further no seller contact was evident on the page too unappetizing ,1
these beans were just as described and i got of them in my lb package like others i was making vanilla and these worked perfectly they were moist and easy to cut extras were saved one thrown in with the sugar for the next round of vanilla making ,1
i can not describe fully the immense calmness this tea brings to you it is as good as being immersed in a warm bubble bath listening to kenny g no ok how about as good as lying in bed on a spring morn feeling the sun warm you and at the same time a wonderful spring breeze blow across you seriously folks this tea is fantastic and very soothing a real treat of fruity tastes but not overwhelming love love love it you will not be disapointed ,1
unlike many almond butter reviewers i am not much of a fan of peanut butter i love almonds know that they are good for us and thought i would try bb to see if i would enjoy having it with celery sticks and or crackers i bought this size because i really was not sure super yummy was my thought when i tried bb for the first time it is a lot like the consistency of natural peanut butter with the oil at the top and the really solid part at the bottom but not nearly as hard to stir thoroughly as pb i love bb i have gone through of the jar package i ordered in record time it is the kind of snack that satisfies that sort of amorphous craving you get sometimes for some little thing to eat i even eat it on the spoon sometimes i have not tried other brands of almond butter and i probably will not so i can not make a fair comparison of this brand to other brands i can not imagine being happier with another product than i was with this one i highly recommend this product ,1
i have been addicted to a good senseo for ages best coffee ever imho just a little dollop of sweeten condensed milk ontop of a double cup of senseo is a perfect beverage thats stimulating warm and simply tasty ,1
absolutely excellent could not stop eating this raw cashews peanuts spanish peanuts walnuts almonds sun flower seeds with big shavings of coconut oat flour covered dates raisins delicious highly recommended went out and weeded the garden with all the energy from this great trail mix ,1
i tried the orgain creamy chocolate fudge and was very happy with the taste i use these as a meal on the go and they have been great i always keep them refrigerated and pop one in the freezer before i drink it so it can be slightly slushy if you leave it for too long you might end up needing to squeeze it out of the box though i also sometimes blend the shake with a banana so tasty it is a little pricey but i have yet to find something less expensive with the same quality and taste overall i was happy enough with them to buy again i might try the vanilla because of other positive reviews but for sure i will order some more chocolate ,1
check out the nutrition facts right below the product name on the amazon page is the manufacturer hoping that uninformed consumers have heard the word omega somewhere and think that it is necessarily good for them nature is path does not tell us which omega or omega it contains beneficial omega are those that we get from foods such as tuna and flax omega are generally what we get from corn fed stockyard beef or from sitting down and swigging a bottle of peanut oil note that this product contains mg of omega and mg of omega more than twice as much of omega as omega the typical god awful american diet contains a ratio of omega to omega nutritional scientists recommend that we drop this diet and try to get at least a ration of omega to omega studies are indicating that omega help the cardiovascular system reduce inflammation may have a helpful role in preventing cancer improve depression in some people and may possibly be helpful in preventing or stabilizing some forms of dementias are these studies far enough along to be conclusive no are they pointing us in some healthy directions yes are positive results encouraging more studies not just lab studies but human studies yes the most positive results so far indicate that omega are very good for our hearts so you get grams of fiber from a product that supposedly contains granola flax seed raisins hemp seeds and sunflower seeds what are they using these fiber rich foods for the box you also get mg of sodium and fourteen grams of sugar along with some saturated fat i have been looking for healthy snacks for my pregnant daughter and i am shocked to see that there is no nutritional value in any of the bars produced by nature is path organic i decided to check out nature is path cereals etc and found the same garbage the words organic nature and nutrition have been prostituted by a lot of greedy companies but this is the most egregious example i have seen in a while i would like to see amazon pull these products if we stop buying them and the market disappears so will the products in the meantime we need to keep educating ourselves and sharing what we learn we need to keep up pressure on the grocery stores supermarkets food banks and places we go when we can not to get to or afford our co op we need to keep ourselves our children our grandchildren and our neighbors healthy well nourished and strong best to all ,0
this is one of the best skin moisturizers you can buy just be careful when you buy that you do not buy a toasted almond oil this is much better ,1
not sure how nutritious this food is it is not rated very well with the dog food community ingredient wise but my dogs loved it i mixed it in with their normal kirkland brand food and it made them eat their normal food with little bits of this food like it was the best thing they have had in their lives the dogs felt like it was treats versus food it smelled and tasted good for them i would not feed this on a normal basis due to the ingredients even though beef is first but for a dog that needs help eating a treaty meal or stimulating appetite this might be a good food enhancer ,1
this coffee was extremely weak and did not taste well i do not recommend wasting your money on it ,0
i went to brazil last summer and loved the coffee i was not able to find brazilian coffee in my local coffee places or supermarkets but i found it on amazon this is great coffee dark flavorful and full bodied i would recommend it to anyone who like french roast ,1
so tasty and delicious you wont even think that your eating healthy i mean with these quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies with raisins who could resisted ,1
very much like a payday bar but a bit less sweet and a bit stickier all in all tasty and satisfying ,1
another dr oz recommendation this is a citrus flavored soy sauce i just love it this is the only soy sauce i like all the others are way too salty ,1
since i am a big fan of sesame seeds i found these pretzels at a local grocery store and tried them pretzels have always been a favorite food of mine but these are definitely the best ones that i have ever had not too salty and the sesame seeds are such a great addition i was so glad to find them on amazon at such an incredible price ,1
i could barely taste the flavor it is so sweet i gave two stars instead of only one because it is really my fault not the maker i did not doing my usual thorough research a minimal google search would have uncovered the fact that sugar is ingredient and corn syrup is yuk i have to say if something taste good i could give a good gosh darn what the color is they add red dye oh why or why must they add dye here is the ingredient list sugar corn syrup natural anise flavor color added including red maybe i can crush em up add flavor and something else to dilute sugar they may be savable oops that is my hoarder tendency talking,0
this is one of the best dark comedies ever if you have not seen this yet you need to watch it with friends and family you will be hooked ,1

i am not much of a dark chocolate eater yet most milk chocolate tastes generic so i tend to stay away from chocolate altogether the thing that interested me in this chocolate was the cacao because i do not ever see milk chocolate with a percentage then again i do not usually pay attention i gave it a try and was surprised that i actually really like it at first it tasted kind of like dark chocolate but it was not bitter or too strong before i knew it my first bar was gone and i was on to the next it is definitely not your average milk chocolate and there is nothing generic about the taste the almonds were good as well and as others mentioned you will not actually taste any sea salt i think i will include this chocolate in my brothers gift baskets for christmas i usually just throw in any fancy looking dark chocolate ,1
good with everything just make rice and beans and scrabled eggs for a costariccan delicious breakfast or brunch we learned that on our trip to costarica,1
the anchovies are outstanding so is the packaging the price was good but not outstanding about cents per can less than the grocery the problem is that they have an expiration date of something like hello who can go through cans of anchovies in less than months perhaps that is the reason for the very reasonable price but at that point i think rather than being sold by amazon they should be at the dollar store or deals com note i purchased these about months ago ,0
this organic is great for a quick snack it is great mixed in yogurt or on ice cream i love that this granola is organic everyone who tried it liked it but i wish there were more bits of chocolate and berries ,1
i aim to feed my cats only the best nutrition i received a sample of this with an order from pet food direct and let them try it like humans i believe the cats can have bad treats in moderation as long as their diet on the whole is a healthy one i have never seen them go so crazy over treats they were literally jumping on me for more so the cats would give this stars but i just wish it did not have so much junk in it i still buy it and give them a few a day ,1
the service for return was poor the product reached me melted and fully bloomed chocolate was white with spots and streaks on the surface though this is something that can be reused by melting not for the seeding for which i would needed this they were not agreeing for return for a product that reached me in a form that was not acceptable i had to explain my need and purpose they did not refund my previous shipment or tax nor did they pay for the return shipment i ended up paying for the return shipment the product is a lot costly through this vendor actually double its price i bought a block of the same chocolate from a local callebaut vendor please research your local listings stop buying through these channels if you want callebaut chocolates call the number in the callebaut website and get the contacts of the local distributor while through this vendor the milk white chocolate for costed me close to with shipping i bought the block from the local distributor for just,0
i love the coffee from coffee bean direct but the price is about more here than if you order directly from the company and if you order all or several flavors you do not have to pay shipping i get together with friends and we place a combined order once a year great coffee and great selection as well as tea ,1
a great way to save money on buying k cups in supermarkets these go for about bucks for cups you save so much money buying them in bulk like this if you use them regularly i just picked up the count after buying the count months in a row ,1
the sweet cinnamon flavor crispy thins from eat think smile are an interesting snack idea the underlying concept of all of their products is that their cocoa is not alkalized the way that most is preserving more natural antioxidants that is all well and good but it still comes down to taste right i like chocolate and cinnamon and i found these to be pretty good the texture is a little different but i do not mind it the only thing i would change would be to make the pieces bigger if you wish to stick to a single serving you would be stuck counting out that is not a typo pieces they should triple the size to make the serving come in around or so and it would be like most snack crackers otherwise i think they are a hit if you are looking for a healthy sweet snack and like chocolate and cinnamon give these a try the taste starts out chocolate with a cinnamon finish ,1
i have been drinking and enjoying the gevalia swiss hazelnut since i purchased my tassimo machine a year ago and would routinely buy it in and packs from amazon i recently noticed that the packaging had changed but assumed it was packaging only i was wrong the coffee in the new packaging is made with a new formula and it is horrible overly sweet and artificial tasting you can not even taste a hint of coffee flavor stay away from this blend my hope is that this is just an issue with a production run or this blend and the other redesigned gevalia t discs actually taste like coffee update i called tassimo direct and complained about the new gevalia swiss hazelnut t discs they were nice enough to offer me a refund exchange and i went ahead and ordered replacement t discs in a different blend i hope these will work out much better i encourage those that are unhappy with this new product to call them voice a complaint and get a refund exchange ,0
i love this sweetener i use it in my coffee and tea it is also good drizzled over fresh fruit it makes a great gift as well i have been buying this for a couple of years the only ingredient listed on the bottle is organic agave nectar it is a product of mexico and distributed from sugar land tx as per bottle label ,1
i just love this item it holds all of my coffee right at my finger tips i also love how the coffee maker can set on top and everything is in one place ,1

i live in venezuela where the worlds finest cacao beans are grown in a remote village that is only accesible through the sea the cacao beans grown there are dried in front of the village church in a process the whole town participates in ironically if venezuelans want to taste their cacao beans turned into chocalate they must buy it from the extremely high end italian chocolatier amedei as amedei has the exclusive rights to all the production of the beans from chuao to the last bean therefore when in europe i searched for the bars amazingly you can find them easily in classy shops at euros a bar at least i finally found the gold medal winning chuao one i took it back to my hotel drank some perier to wash out all flavor from my mouth sat comfortably and mentally went over the ritual of tasting fine chocolates i took the first piece placed it whole on my tongue you are not supposed to bite pressed it against the palate and let it do it is magic the richness strength and intense flavor impressed me from the start as it melted evenly on my tongue i felt the gnarl of chocalate is natural bitterness but more woody remiscent of royal salute scotch but with a sweet smoothness that relaxed my mind the impressive effect was the aftertaste the taste of nutty bittersweet wood stayed on my tongue as if the chocolate was still there not until i drank more perrier did it go away a unique experience in chocolate tasting i do not recommend a bud guzzlin guy to spend money on high end chocolate such as this one you can but you might end up saying that a good ol american hershey bar is better it is like fine art if you know nothing about it you will not fully appreciate it i recommend it for people that like chocolate and have tried and enjoyed at least mid range chocolates such as lindt and godiva and especially if you have tried high end type such as cluizel scharffen berger and valrhona ,1
like most of the other reviews state you can use this product for just about anything cooking hair care skin care the list goes on and on it is also great to give to your fur kids of which i have i use this in my baking to replace butter shortening or margarine and you can not tell the difference love it ,1
i have been using this for about two months always at least once a day and while i definitely can say sure this is okay i would not go out of my way to suggest or recommend it i like that there are no super crazy or funky ingredients i can put this all over my eyes with zero irritation and no itching and i have to admit i really love the smell yum it seems a lot stronger when you first start using it but it disappears pretty quickly the product the cream is a white thin lotion that spreads easily it is not the kind of lotion that instantly absorbs into your skin and a little goes a long way there is going to be a moist film left behind for a while so if you are an instant absorption sort of person this might catch you off guard however i like that it does not instantly dry because my eyes feel more hydrated the packaging there are several comments talking about how crappy the pump is and how it breaks easily i have not experienced it directly breaking but i can see how people might have problems the pump does not pull lotion from very deep inside the bottle so it leaves behind a gap in the lotion eventually each time you pump because it does not settle to fill the spot after use if you squeeze from the bottom of the bottle a little bit before using or unscrew the top and jostle the bottle a bit you will be able to fill that hole created over time through using the pump results i am in my early and have been blessed with pretty good genes so wrinkles and puffy under eyes really are not a huge issue for me however i really love how moisturizing and hydrating this cream is the smell is pleasant and i am probably about halfway through the tube in two months so i would say it is a decent bang for my buck give it a shot if wrinkles and puffiness are a concern for you this might not be your holy grail product but it is also inexpensive enough that i think it is worth trying out without feeling awful if it does not work one tiny note i do not know if this is relevant but i have noticed since using this product i seem to have gained a small cluster of freckles around my eyes in places i have never had freckles before i do not know if it is from this product but it certainly struck me as unusual ,1
this is not an over the top sugary drink mix like kool aid as others pointed out it is on the sour side while not what i was expecting at first i still find it to be a refreshing mix i have just received my second subscribe and save shipment of this the other week shortly before amazon removed it from that service in the first shipment i had received there were a number of packets where the powder had solidified a bit as another reviewer reported i think i calculated about of the packets in that shipment had that problem the only issue this gave me was getting the mix out of the packet some alternate squeezing of the packet would break up the chunk enough to drop out into my water bottle it took a little longer to dissolve but then was fine in the most recent shipment all packets felt and sounded to be in loose powder form the only other complaint i have is that the packets never seemed to tear open well as a result i find it easier to cut them open with scissors not a problem for me as i drink these in my office cubicle when this shipment runs out i intend to order a restock hopefully it is available again at the sns discount ,1
i have tried most organic steel cut oats and this is a really good value per ounce of product very easy to prepare and consistent quality ,1
caramel popcorn is a tried and true snack and is always worth having snackwells adds a drizzle of fudge which adds a tasteful hint to the popcorn that does not crowd in with the caramel taste these come in a set of six packs that make it easy not to shovel it into your mouth indeed i found myself eating one pop at a time and really just enjoying it worth a try ,1
i love this granola it is all natural and lower calorie allowing me to incorporate this into my diet try this on top of yogurt and what a combo i can not find these in my local stores anymore and so i am glad i found them on amazon better price too just be careful to stick to the cup easy to eat too much because it is so good ,1
i did have to bake the crust a little longer but wow was this a good crust unlike any other store bought crust i have found absolutely no rice taste at all ,1
i like these sausages better than other products from this company yes they are a little expensive but worth it i v tried them boiled fried and grilled with excellent result highly recommended check for specials for free shipping since it saves about off the total price ,1
excellent and really fantastic addition to good earth is lineup the cocoa taste is noticeable but not overpowering and as some have noted it is a great tea to help curb a sweet tooth why though does the only case price available here work out to be a box when you can buy this for in most stores and all the other good earth lineup via amazon are approx case weird edit nov looks like the price has been corrected and this is now inline with the other good earth on the site at around good stuff ,1
 update these are now in my regular lunch rotation regardless of whether that is during the school year or during summer the meal presented in this kit is healthy and delicious and the perfect size for carrying aboard a long flight on a road trip or for a quick lunch at work for me amazon is subscribe save feature also adds an extra incentive to keep these on hand with the discount off coupon promo that is currently on for it and the free shipping feature so many reasons to keep these around i got lucky enough to come across one of these at of all places my local tj maxx store having tried the had a delightful tang and was delicious there was plenty to cover every crunchmaster cracker pieces and all and still enough left to squeeze a generous dollop onto my finger for a final tangy treat as always the box contained a delicious smooth square of dark chocolate that was just the right amount of sweet and tasty without being too much of anything else the box also had a sudoku puzzle on the bottom of it as had the box containing the salmon salad meal that i would tried before overall i am finding that these gopicnic meals are just right for me for a satisfying cold lunch at work when i do not have time to nuke anything before my next class and i am seriously considering subscribing to one of em just to have em around i honestly wish amazon would make up a variety pack of these as an option because having liked both of the two that i have tried i am starting to think that i would like em all delicious convenient and healthy this one covers all the bases ,1
i recently found this baby food for my child i had never used this type of packaging before but i love it we on the go more with her two older brothers so this package is convenient and she is at an age where she can suck it out herself we also live in an area where mangos are not prevelant so this is a great option ,1

this item arrived promptly as described on amazon however of the cans were dented they were packaged well for shipment so maybe the damage came from the manufacturer will be contacting the seller to inform them,1
i am basing my review on taste alone and disregarding any nutritional information if you like ranch dressing with a little zing to it then you will like this stuff it is basically the same sauce that taco bell uses on their chalupas even though i have a high heat tolerance i could not imagine anyone thinking this is hot i am not even sure bold is an appropriate word it just has a bit spiciness that is not to say that i do not like it though it is a delicious sauce that is good with wraps sandwiches salads and numerous other things it would also be great with numerous chicken preparations and mexican dishes and i even used it with a baked fish dish overall it is a tasty sauce and i would buy it again ,1
i love these sticks i have purchased boxes from amazon and i have bought many from local stores these are the best tasting sticks i have ever had just wish i could get them by the case yum yum ,1
nom nom nom yum i love this stuff i did not buy the real energy drink because the price was repugnant this stuff tastes better than that canned stuff nom nom nom ,1

i love these very gingery candies sweet with a spicy kick i used to find them at trader joes and target but recently they have dissappeared they are good for mild nausea and indegstion as well as being a tasty treat if you like ginger try some of these naturally flavored treats today ,1
why does this bone have to contain chicken meal and poultry flavor it is a peanut butter bone the reason i purchased it is because it was advertised as peanut butter my dog has a chicken sensitivity and would have gotten the runs like mad had i not read the label before giving it to him rather than return it because the shipping would have cost the same as what i paid for the item i took the filling out and gave him the plain bone i will refill it with some regular jiff if need be it would have been helpful for the company to disclose the ingredients in these so called peanut butter flavored things chicken is not peanut butter ,0
o k seriously is that star guy kidding these soup packets are absolutely delicious from what he wrote i am guessing he never has even eaten one ,1

my year old has nut allergies among others and this product has replaced peanut butter in our house my year old who used to eat regular peanut butter enjoys the sunbutter just as much and will eat it from the spoon the taste is not exactly like peanut butter but it is nutty and delicious and after a few weeks you will not even notice or miss peanut butter we tried a couple other peanut butter alternatives and they were terrible i am so thankful that this is around for my kids who would miss out on pb j otherwise ,1
i thought these were great for the price i used a coupon i can see where alot of people could be turned off as it has a distinctive taste but i loved them these blow those regular store brand quaker oats type bars out of the water ,1
product flavor is superb product delivered on time bulk pack made price economical and best price found for identical product offered elsewhere will continue to purchase the pack offering ,1
i got this item for my office pantry and have been selling it at cost for cents a bag it has been well received and sells quickly most people like that it is tasty but not incredibly bad for you although for a family of buying bags of this stuff would be a little too much of the same thing overall a real crowd pleaser ,1
my daughter and her new husband have the problem of converting two complete households into a single one so i was confounded when seeking a wedding gift for them i finally settled on the pub cheese assortment as something they could enjoy that would not add to the complexity not only did they enjoy it but they served the cheeses to guests at a wine tasting who also loved the different cheeses and insisted on knowing where they found them it could easily become my favorite wedding gift as well as my favorite way to enjoy learning more about cheeses i can not find in my local supermarket i highly recommend this assortment as well as many others offered by amazon com my own plan is to try them all ,1
popcorn is very delicious however some of the packages have been very oily and thus make grasping them to put in my popcorn maker a task ,1

i am not really a tea drinker but my husband is and he loves this tea he drinks several cups a day and can not do without it so on his behalf i am recommending it i did taste it and went yuck but i am not a tea lover in fact i hate tea so disregard my comments and just go on my hubby is recommendation ,1
i have heard about the benefits of this type of fat and so finally bought some when it was on special here it was still sort of expensive but i had heard so many good things about it i bought it i now have a lot of it in my pantry the coconut flavor is very strong i thought that perhaps it would cook off but it does not nobody liked the flavor of coconut in food that are not supposed to have coconut therefore i only use it when i am cooking stir fry or asian then it is fine but it is a lot of product to have around for or meals a month ,0

 numi tea is golden chai spiced assam black tea is a premium numi tea both certified organic and kosher the ingredients are fair trade certified organic assam black tea organic cinnamon organic chinese ginger organic green cardamom and organic turkish anise there is nothing artificial in this or in any numi tea on the box the manufacturer writes throughout india chai stalls are a meeting place for provocative tea and conversation from its homeland in china chai has journeyed as chai th and tea recreating itself in every land numi is golden brewed organic chai fuses rich cultures in a complex and hearty assam black tea indian cinnamon and mild green cardamom evoke a warm balance with the vitality of chinese ginger the peaked sweet aroma of turkish anise exhilarates memories reminisce in aged tradition with an inspiring cup of golden chai although this is a chai note that it contains no sweeteners i prefer this and the anise gives a certain type of mild sweetness but commercial chais often have sugar added so be prepared for a wonderful no calorie indulgence that is beautifully flavored but not sweet in the same way that sugar is golden chai is also caffeinated if you want a caffeine free chai try numi tea is ruby chai spiced rooibos herbal teasan instead the price is perfect a big savings over single boxes if you like numi teas get it you will not be sorry if you are new to numi but love chai this will probably be the best you have ever had highly recommended ,1
i like all the zevia flavors i am so glad that i have some many flavor choices to chose from now i drink the lime cola when i feel like being in a tropical mood great job zevia ,1
i love this stuff wild ride kickin teriyaki has no nitrites and no msg it is made with natural ingredients which is about as healthy as you can get while still eating beef it is also low in calories an entire bag is only calories or calories per serving high in protein and low in fat i am watching my weight and wild ride is a welcome addition to my balanced diet essentially it is sliced steak in a bag an average piece is bite size about one inch square and about inch thick keep in mind that wild ride is definitely not shoe leather tough like most jerky products thus traditional beef jerky lovers may be put off by the tender quality of the meat if you are looking for tough meat with the consistency of a radial tire then buy something else but if you want beef jerky that is chewy tender and flavorful get this product i have only one complaint about in bags have a few pieces containing gristle or sinew the pieces do not break down completely when you chew them while this is an inconvenience the problem is still minor enough for me to give the product five stars based on overall taste and quality kickin teriyaki is slightly sweet like teriyaki sauce and not too salty it is one of my favorite wild ride flavors mmmmmm yummy ,1
so i no longer have to ask anyone to go through the hassle of having them go to the quicky mart to procure my coffee if you do not want to do the quicky mart route just do what i am doing and buy from this vendor why not ,1
i ate a lot of biltong as a child since we lived in africa we also tried making it ourselves at one point and we had friends who made it on occasion it tastes a lot different from the overly salted beef jerky you can buy in america i was amazed that this product is made in america since it tastes exactly like the biltong i remember from childhood since i ordered some other products along with this biltong i was only charged for shipping instead of however i would willingly pay the higher price just for the taste of truly good biltong the rebecca review,1
i am not a person with a sweet tooth but omg these candies are addictive i am very pleased to find them on amazon for such a bargain obviously i also think tropifrutti is the best out of all haribo candies but there are other good varieties including the famous gold bears but only tropifrutti has it so bad on me that i can eat a whole package in one go ,1
great product and i got it at a great price atleast now i dont have to do rounds to my grocery store which charges much more ,1
i have to admit i first purchased these hazelnut k cups because of the low price i had to pick some up for the office and the price was right i was very pleasantly surprised with the coffee better flavor than some k cups that cost a lot more ,1
recently i have been searching for a good ginger tea preferably something that captures the awesome spiciness and flavor of ginger after trying the organic ginger aid tea by traditional medicinals and being disappointed see my review on that i decided to try out this tea instead so how was it well it was good and bad it has spicy ginger in its title but it is not spicy at all and you can not really taste the ginger so in that sense its pretty bad however its still delicious as a tea and has a very pleasant lemony flavor probably due to the lemon myrtle i do not normally like lemony tasting teas but i absolutely loved this one so that really says something unfortunately this tea does not really satisfy my craving for ginger flavor i would recommend it however to those who want the health benefits of ginger but hate the taste this would be perfect for those sorts of people i later discovered that you can make an excellent ginger tea by just boiling some fresh ginger root slices in water this resulted in excellent spicy ginger tea and was very cheap to make since ginger roots are pretty inexpensive so i really recommend this method over buying this tea if you just want ginger flavor however i will still probably buy this tea since i love it is taste so much otherwise in fact if you are just looking for a tasty good tea and do not care about having ginger flavor then i recommend you pick this up i only wish they would change the name to something like lemon myrtle organic blend or some such so that it would more accurately describe the taste that buyers are going to get other than that though it gets stars simply for still being delicious ,1
i had a new chain link fence installed to contain my lab smart lab found out that she could still get out going under the chain link right between two support poles at the base of the fencing enter the fido shocker we used an outside porch light which had two bulbs removed one bulb and installed a piece from the hardware store that looked like the threaded end of a light bulb but was an electical outlet this is where we plugged the charger in we ran the wire around the base of the fencing inside the yard when the back porch light was on the fence was hot the dog touched it with her nose twice it made her yelp then she decided it was easier to just remain in the yard well worth the money easy to set up in a short amount of time my husband touched it to see how strong it was he warned me not to touch it becuase he felt is was strong enough it might bring tears to my eyes so i never touched it when we moved we took it all down put it in the box and i still have it but have not needed to use it since then it works ,1
this product was as advertized and arrived at my house just as they said it would buying in bulk makes purchasing much easier ,1
great tasting and healthy snacks and the small size helps you from over eating use them also for little gifts to the grandkids ,1
four roses distillery is currently producing some of the best and most exciting bourbons in america which may be news to you because that is a relatively recent development four roses was a venerable century brand and a top seller in the us until mid century when then current owner seagrams decided to export the good stuff to europe and asia and debase the brand by only selling low end blends in the us that is how it was for almost years it was not until when master distiller jim rutledge came and ownership changed a couple of times that the brand became something good again and not just good extraordinary four roses makes a range of special limited releases as well as their standing specialties like a lot of high end bourbon distillers they also make a single barrel version that varies from cask to cask but four roses takes it a monumental level further by actually varying the recipe used to produce the bourbon with startling different results the ten different recipes four roses uses are described as followed on their web site from the four roses web site four roses is the only bourbon distillery that combines five proprietary yeast strains with two separate mashbills to produce distinct and handcrafted bourbon recipes each with its own unique character spiciness and rich fruity flavors what the letter designations mean for the recipes o designates produced at the four roses distillery in lawrenceburg ky e the mashbill that is corn rye malted barley b the mashbill that is corn rye malted barley s designates straight whiskey distillation v k o q f yeast strain used to create flavor characteristics and here are the recipes along with the descriptions of flavor and some have listings of the releases that featured that recipe obsv delicate fruit spicy creamy four roses single barrel the mariage collection release limited edition barrel strength bourbonobsk rich in spiciness full body small batch anniversaryobso slightly fruity spicy medium body four roses small batchobsq floral rose petal spicy medium body limited edition barrel strengthobsf mint fruity spicy full bodyoesv delicate fruit fresh creamyoesk spicy full body four roses small batch the mariage collection releaseoeso fruity red berries medium body anniversary barrel strength bourbon four roses small batchoesq floral banana fresh medium body limited edition barrel strength bourbonoesf mint fruity full body in this review i am tasting a single barrel bottle from barrel warehouse bn bottled at using recipe obsq in the glass it is orangy copper new penny amber colored the nose is sweet with honey clover flower and the tang of grape noble rot rancio in the cognac world with more time more classicly bourbon notes of toffee and leather creep infirst entry is sugar beets with a rush of vinous rancio white raisins sherry notes mouth feel is silky with good but not thick syrup factor spicy around edge of tongue proof showing up herbal notes proliferate in the transition to the finish cilantro and parsley maybe some ivy as the glow fades the oak tannins join the medicinal herbal edge of bitterness and the honey and the sherry cognac rancio ends up feeling almost dry this is a sophisticated and elegant flavor profile that feels almost more like a wood aged european eau de vie than a kentucky bourbon but inhaling as the long finish fades brings up echoes of burnt sugar leather and tobacco conjured out the fading viney and herbal flavors so i know this is kentucky straight bourbon whiskey just bourbon of a higher and more refined sort this bourbon is so good so different so unique i can not wait to try other single barrel expressions i will be looking out for them ,1
i really like this mac and cheese it is easy to make and much better for you than the leading national brand i love that it is organic and does not have artificial flavors or colors i will definitely buy this again soon ,1
huge great i am loving it very hot sweet stars for this one ,1
i tried this product after years of using corn based xylitol even though it is said there are no corn proteins thus potential allergens remaining in the final product of corn based xylitol and all of the companies i contacted insisted their china sourced xylitol was organic and free of gmo is i decided to switch to a birch based xylitol none of the corn based xylitol distributors i contacted could actually certify this information and few will back up their claims in writing on their websites i also contacted the distributor of this particular product zveet who told me that although their birch trees are not certified organic they also do not use any chemicals on the trees this is pretty much what the corn based china sourced xylitol distributors said and although i might have missed it i could not find this confirmed on their website either while i would love to find a xylitol product that certifies such claims i decided to take them at their word and i tried the product since their product is originating in the us i found it to be nearly identical to corn based xylitol with really only two exceptions the crystals appear slightly larger which really does not impact anything and it tastes a bit cooler many people comment on the cool taste of xylitol which i have never noticed until now and i found it very pleasant other than this it is the same as all the corn based xylitol i have used it also has the same level of sweetness which is somewhat lower than sugar you can counter this by either adding a bit more xylitol to the product about seems to do the trick or by adjusting to a slightly less sweet taste birch based xylitol appears to be the same in calories as corn based which is lower than cane sugar and better for your health than sugar or fructose over all i use xylitol along with a bit of himalayan sea salt in my nasal wash since it has soothing properties for delicate membranes i also use it to sweeten my tea and in cooking and baking just like regular cane sugar without all the negative effects xylitol is very low on the glycemic index it is a prebiotic meaning it is fermented in the gut creating short chain fatty acids scfa which encourage the growth of good micro organisms vs sugar and other fructose sources which encourage the growth of harmful bacteria and yeasts it is an anti inflammatory vs sugar which causes inflammation there are so many reasons to use xylitol instead of sugar that i could go on and on but i feel this would be out of the scope of my review my only reservation regarding xylitol in general is that it is still a highly processed food so if for no other reason it is probably best to limit the amount of consumption i thought zveet would be my new go to xylitol and was prepared to place another order to my surprise the price increased more than in only one month from last month to today is price of there really is no good reason for a price jump of this magnitude so i deducted one star for unstable pricing my usual supplier natrazyle kosher xylitol has remained fairly consistent in terms of low prices it is currently lbs on amazon of all the companies i contacted natrazyle appeared to be one of the few willing to post on their website that their corn is grown without the use of pesticides and is non gmo so it has been my primary source since price is a factor i will probably continue to order natrazyle if zveet brings the cost down and it remains stable i will probably return as a customer if only to support us manufacturing ,1
i recently ordered edward sons not beef bouilon cubes and confess that the flavor frightens me the taste is so close to actual beef bouilon that i have had to re read the ingredients just about every time that i have used it additionally edward son uses palm oil palm oil has the same texture as beef fat and can be scraped off the top just one would scrape fat off of broth the flavor is excellent for making seitan i have used it for the simmering broth as well as put a cube into the actual seitan mix very tasty ,1
i received the babycook as a gift and i absolutely love it here is how it works pour some water into the reservoir tank load food into the steamer basket which sits right in the grinder bowl it steams the food perfectly then you dump the food from the steamer basket into the grinder portion grind and viola you have baby food i agree with other reviewers that you can grab your steamer and your blender and probably get similar results but now you have got a counter full of kitchen appliances you have to perfect your steaming capabilities what a pain this little guy stores easily in a cupboard you bring him out and he cooks and grinds the food clean up is a breeze so worth the investment oh yah i forgot mine was a gift but i would buy one in a heartbeat seriously it makes making baby food a breeze i think it would be a chore to bring out the steamer bring out the blender or food processor use them wash them put them away i am lazy and this little guy makes my baby food making adventures so simple buy it stop thinking about it ,1
i have always loved chebe products since finding out about them since they have changed their packaging and preparation instructions i have found that adding the full amount of water to the mix makes for a sticky mess it ends up all over my hands and i cannot work the dough if i add a little less water i can prepare them with ease i have used parmesan mozzarella and cheddar jack cheese with the mix and they are all yummy ,1
love to have a strong cup of tea and pg tips is wonderful i first had this tea in london great deal from amazon ,1
this soup has a lot of sand in it i could not choke it down when i tried it last week it is a quick meal but it is no fun eating soup n sand chowder they need to improve on their quality control or discontinue the product all together avoid this stuff ,0
i was looking for the secret to movie popcorn and i found it with flavacol along with coconut oil it is even better than movie popcorn because you can make it at home ,1
this coffee is finely ground so it has a good powdery consistency typically this means you will need to use less of it for brewing my wife and i like strong coffee but this coffee is very strong almost to the point that it is muddy the coffee smells like vanilla that is not an issue however i feel that the coffee blend overpowers the vanilla flavor the coffee appears to be so darkly roasted that you taste more coffee than vanilla this coffee tastes better with milk added which helps cut through the bitterness of the blend the bag is typical packaging designed to keep the coffee fresh once opened it can be folded down and sealed with an attached wire clip the bag is imprinted with a bonus take the empty bag to a starbucks and you get a free tall coffee it is coffee but not something i would enjoy on a regular basis this may be a once a week blend for me it is just too strong and lacks a clear vanilla balance ,0
my yr old border collie my yr old dachshund miniature pincher mix and my yr old miniature pincher just love this it is easy on their digestive systems i just wish it came in larger bags if they let you purchase lb bags prime shipping why will not they let you purchase lb bag prime shipping i hope someone at amazon is listening it is hard for me to lug home lb bags from walmart but it is actually cheaper but i opt for ease due to my physical limitations ,1
have no idea how they did that try it with a starbucks omg i am half waiting for some bad side effect because usually things this good have something bad right kidding this stuff rocks ,1
nice flavor and the antioxidants are a bonus but each canister only contains tubs quarts ,1
omg is anyone reading what is in this crap mineral oil and petroleum two no no is for heathy hair and scalp what is wrong with these people that shit clogs the pores on the scalp and hair follicle why would anyone looking to maintain hair health use this ,0
the flavor of this cappuccino is wonderful even if you put too much mix in the mug it is still great i am stocking up for winter ,1
this is really good vanilla extract in a bottle size that is much better suited to the amount of baking i do than the much smaller bottles available in my local grocery store not a bad buy either ,1
moderately flavorful with no trace of bitterness low acidity nice aroma i had to use significantly more per pot than the package specifies but that is usually the case with my cuisinart drip coffee maker ,1
makes great waffles it is the same recipe used at many hotels simple to make cup of water tbs butter one egg and one cup of mix the malt flavor is great too ,1
all koreans know the taste of real jjajangmeon that you can only get at specialty restaurants you can never duplicate that taste at home no matter what product you buy between the various instant minute styles however i have tried about or so different brands and styles this is the best one the vegies are less mushy than the others and the sauce is a little less synthetic tasting i like to slice in some cucumber and onions and it does the trick for a quick snack now to find some authentic noodles ,1
i got this lucky bamboo this morning right before work i work from home and sit at my desk all day long i loved this it was the perfect gift i love orchids they are my favorite although these orchids are artificial they are still perfect for the live bamboo stalk my dad the sender thought they were real but none the less i just adore this beautiful and perfect size arrangement on my desk ,1
i do not know how anyone could rate this so called cat food above a star it is crud the food is cheap stuffed full of fillers my cats prefer to eat old and dried up fancy feast crumbs before they even eat a bite of this junk it comes out of the cans like a hard lump the liquids drain out and you end up with a brick that has to be broken apart well it is not so surprising this stuff ends up as hard as a brick one of the major ingredients in all their flavors is montmorillonite clay yes the same stuff used in oil and gas well drilling mud ie very similar to what cat litter is made from to show how bad it is even the raccoons and coyotes will not eat this junk they would rather eat carrion those that think this is good food i can not imagine the crud you have been feeding your cats before shame on you shame on anyone buying this crud go buy a selection of fancy feast classic is hands down favorite for the majority of cats and it is excellent quality food puts this junk to shame and see how quickly your cats will spurn this junk i wish i could give this crud negative stars it should not be allowed to be sold ,0
the first thing you notice about this cereal is the aroma it is reminiscent of fish oil supplements having never eaten flax of any kind before i do not know if the aroma is typical of flax at first serving i was sure i would consume the rest of the box eventually but would not buy more yet with each serving the aroma is less and less noticeable i enjoy this cereal and will buy it again it has more fiber than any other cereal organic or not i have seen ,1
this is the best snack of its kind that i have ever tried and i have tried many the wasabi has a little kick to it but not enough to slow down the copious amounts of the snack that i find myself devouring in one sitting and the sweet cranberries are a great little treat in every bite there is a little bit of peanut dust and paper shells at the bottom of each bag which can be messy but if you like a snack with a little bite to it this is your treat ,1
i just recieved starbucks caffe verona kcups from oranges to dollars loose in a cardboard box and many of the cups are swollen the aluminum lid has ballooned up there is no way to tell the freshness of the product and i am going to assume that because many have popped tops they are not fresh product having ordered many cases of kcups over the years i have never seen the likes of this it looks like they have taken these cups from many other boxes and threw them into a box without a care whatso ever to the quality of said coffee containers first and last time i felt like i have been slapped fortunately i happen to have two storage cases for kcups what if i did not and i was not even afforded the luxury of simple product packaging to have some form of containment done oranges to dollars you made lemons into lemonade and a nice profit ,0
timothy is decaf colombian is a nice full bodied medium roast coffee it is one of my favorite coffees as it is mellow flavorful and not bitter or too strong ,1
outstanding gourmet taste the blend of mushrooms steak and sauce is tantalyzing the orders could be divided so that the entire order doe not have to be defrosted at once possibly divide the large portion into three or four smaller ones as it stands the order is easily microwavable ,1
i thought since most of the chicken helpers are not bad that this would be good as well boy was i wrong it has a sweet sickening taste i could not stomach more than one bite not sure how this one got past the taste testers but they were way off ,0
i planted the spores just like the directions said and still nothing is growing its been one and a half months since i planted them i would not recommend this product to anyone,0
now we are not big juice drinkers in this family we take apple juice or cherry juice and mix it with unflavored seltzer water because otherwise we find it too sweet this is the same it is nicely carbonated and it has a pretty authentic fruit taste but it is still too sickly sweet cut it half and half with unflavored seltzer and a little ice and you will be happy ,1
no sugar at all only fruit concentrate sweeteners you can see the black and tiny banana seeds on the sides of the transparent bottle oz bottle can last more than servings if used to just give the fruity taste to your drinks i used it for my whey protein isolates drink and it tastes pretty great,1
overall this is a great product the herbs were wonderful with the exception of the chives having fresh pestos and cilantro through the colder months was great after we used up the tablets last spring we planted the entire insert into window boxes and continued to get great harvests all summer in fact the chives came back this spring and are growing better than they did last year tomatoes were a disappointment it was hard to get the flowers fertilized and the ones that started growing kept running into the light the yellow produced a decent amount but the reds did not start to produce until we were running out of tablets the only good thing is that once they were at this size they stayed healthy even without pump running or tablets and now we have them in the garden and will have to wait if they continue to produce letting the machine soak in water for a bit after the aerogarden has been dry is recommended to soften the roots and lesson the noise we also found that a good cleaning of the metal contacts on the lightpost and the pump with isopropanol was essential we got a free pump replacement but in retrospect the first pump would have been fine with cleaning the contacts ,1
i can not figure out how to load the trap it comes with two metal levers which you are to use to set the spring this will require some strength i would sent it back but i beleive there is a restocking fee ,0
how can any coffee latte with the primary ingredients of sugar and non dairy creamer which is actually hydrogenated oil be marketed as healthy in order to have a therapeutic dosage of ganoderma lingzhi the shell of the spore must be broken and you have to have well over of the lingzhi ganoderma based upon the person is weight and condition to be effective nice tasting coffee but not a healthy coffee you would do better going to get some folgers and keep the money in your pocket ,0
paradise tropical tea is my favorite tea of all time i do not drink coffee but every morning summer or winter i have a tall glass of iced tea a grand way to start the morning passion fruit is my preferred flavor but the original is also good i have tried many brands of tea and paradise is tops without peer ,1

i have always been a huge fan of rice vermicelli in asian foods the only setback is that most rice vermicelli is made from processed refined flour hence the carbohydrates are simple not complex this means that the carbohydrate is converted to sugar in your system and it induces in your system a feeling of crash and burn peacock brown rice vermicelli is made from complex carbohydrates this means your body will process and convert the nutrients more sustainably a great recipe for these noodles is very simple and incredibly satisfying sautee one onion with cloves of garlic with a tablespoon of grape seed oil cook until golden brown add of a head of red cabbage soy sauce peanut butter and minced ginger add tofu and water softened vermicelli soak for one minute prior to adding to recipe cook until all ingredients are soft serve warm with a cup of oolong tea on the side delicious ,1
these peanut butter bars are my latest addiction i actually do not usually like bars but i started eating these to slim down post babies i eat half for breakfast with an espresso and have the other half for an afternoon snack while i do not feel stuffed full after eating half i am satisfied and can make it hours to my next snack or meal it tastes great not too sweet like a candy bar but sweet enough to curb my afternoon cravings also the subscribe and save deal on amazon can not be beat ,1
wright is liquid smoke is the only product my daddy would use in his bbq sauce that was famous in oklahoma city during the it is great and we love it it is kinda hard to find locally so it is so great to be able to purchase it over amazon and the price is right too ,1
i keep a carton of these in the fridge for time crunch occasions when one of us has an early morning doctor is appointment for example we grab a bar to eat in the car or after the doc is visit a crunchy nutty nutritious energy bar at calories that tastes good is definitely something i will keep buying until i found them on amazon com it was touch and go as to whether or not i could get them at all very few places carry kashi bars ,1
these puffs are great for a snack for my toddler he loves all the flavors of these but banana most of all my husband and i even tried one ourselves to see what they were like in my opinion the banana aroma is much stronger than the flavoring it is not a bad thing there is just a very strong aroma of bananas when you open the container so if i had not tried these myself i would assume my son is getting a flavor sugar overload that is not the case there is just enough flavoring to make these good my husband who hates fruit of any kind and refuses to eat it actually said these were not bad coming from him that is a huge compliment ,1
absolutely delicious the size is great although there is kind of a lot of packaging i like to enjoy some with a nice cold beer ,1
these do not have the texture of a regular jelly belly they are super waxy and the flavors are not pleasant that being said my husband and i go by the pet name of peas and carrots so it made a cute decorative candy dish at our anniversary party ,0
i received this product three months ago the first seeds started to grow then died within a few weeks the customer service center is taking a month or more to get back to customers two months later they say that they will send me a new package of seeds great except after one week the bulb burnt out after only a total of three weeks of use at the beginning and one this time so now these seeds are going to fail too ridiculous to pay so much for nothing ,0
this stuff is amazing my friend and i had a cook off on thanksgiving everything was the same except i injected mine with tony cachere is butter marinade and let is just say i won hands down the meat was falling off the bone it was so tender and flavorfull and moist best thanksgiving turkey i have since tried it with chicken in a crock pot and its just as great i can not wait to try it on other stuff next ,1

my dog loved the food but two days later my dog was very sick i got the on sale so i was afraid it was expired but it wasnt now a cheep dog food turned into a expensive vet visit i thought i was doing him a favor by buying healthier food but not for my dog,0
i love this tea at a pound delivered it is a bargain i can afford to make it good and strong and usually do brewings from a single pot custom i learned in west africa i also take a cue from my peace corps stay in senegal where they add mint to the pot tho i avoid the traditional sugar as far as i can tell this gunpowder green is the same stuff they used in africa so the nostalgia factor is a big part of the experience especially late at night during ramadan ,1
a slightly aggressive approach gives way to a fullness that is unmatched by the other so called extra bold varieties the finish is crisp clean and ultimately satisfying after several cups one begins to contemplate that there might be an even darker more fulfilling blend out there somewhere perhaps being plucked from deep within a jungle or rain forest or the side of a volcano perchance there is but until that is discovered i must continue to let the magic wash across my taste buds and deal with the sadness that follows the completion of a cup knowing that the next cup has yet to be poured salut ,1
i used to buy daiquiris and margaritas already mixed in individual freezer bags and enjoyed the convenience very much for some reason i cannot find these anymore btw there are some made by daily is but they are made with wine not liquour but taste really good anyway still i was looking for my favorite cocktails in a portable bag these were very good they are very fruity with real strawberry seeds and creamy not like kool aid also they freeze really well no big sharp shards of ice but with a squeeze or two they were more like a slushy to make you open the twist cap fill first with rum to a premarked line shake to mix then fill the rest of the way with water and freeze i made the first batch just this way by pouring the liquor right in the bag up to the fill line on the packaging i do not know if i had the bag set on the counter incorrectly or what but the powder seemed to absorb the liquid and i ended up pouring too much rum in the bag and had not even reached the line it did not even freeze too well as it was too strong we did drink them anyway with the second bag i measured the rum in a measuring cup cups it is written on the bag too they were better you can vary the amount of liqour to your taste or even use different kinds of alcohol or i suppose none at all if you want one more fun tip i mixed the entire bag then poured individual servings into small ziploc freezer bags i think i used about or little ziplocs per lt blender bag which makes gallon then i froze all the little bags that way we could take only when we wanted it or we could throw a few in our beach bags and they stayed slushy for hours plus we did not have to carry much garbage when we were done like with cans or bottles also we did not have to worry about doling out servings into cups or anything just slip a straw into a little opening in the zipper and enjoy ,1
all of schar is products are noticeably superior to many other gluten free brands i love their pasta i have never had problems with mushiness crumbling or any other classic gluten free characteristics with this pasta ,1

this iced tea is terrible this is the first stash product that i do not enjoy it is not iced tea it tastes more like powdered peppermint leaves ,0
these kept me healthy through college a great studying snack because the fruit and nuts both keep you energized and facilitate brain function at least that is what my nutritionist friend told me end result was i graduated engineering in years with a great gpa and i did not gain weight like most of my dorm buddies even though i had very little time for exercise seriously send your kid a pack of these instead of cookies or candy they will thank you my favorite bar was lemon although i think that is a personal preference have not tried all of them but i mean too my new husband and my father both need a health makeover one needs to watch glycemic impact the other needs to watch fat sodium but both love junk food and so i am going to try and get them into these too ,1
after first trying virgil is root beer a few years ago i have become a bit of a soda connoissuer especially with root beer once you get past the big name brands you will find there is a wide world of truly delicious flavors out there that corn syrup and industrial processes could never offer i have tried tons of specialty root beers out there easily over in all if i have not heard of it in an impulse i will buy it and capt n eli is is the best stuff i have found capt n eli is uses all natural ingredients including wintergreen oil anise vanilla and other various spices this does not make it particularly different from virgil is or other top quality root beers however there is something special about this one capt n eli is is superbly clean and crisp with a vibrant multitude of flavors that will dance down your throat as its ultra creamy head satisfies your every taste bud it is super creamy super delicious and ultra lively it is the most vibrant lively root beer i have ever tasted and if i want real refreshment i far prefer one of these over anything else the stuff is seriously tough to put down so what are you waiting for do not think just buy you can thank me later ,1
got a keurig for christmas so i have been having fun trying the wide variety of available k cup products so far this is my favorite of all the coffees and one of the few i would stack up against a good cup of freshly ground and brewed regular coffee usually i like k cups because they are convenient i like these because they are truly excellent coffee and taste wonderful these and coffee people is extra bold varieties are good enough to pass for the real thing no one would ever suspect they were k cups if you did not tell them ,1
definitely the best box pancake mix i have ever had and it is nice that it is gf too i used to make pancakes waffles by scratch but this mix is great and saves me time when i just want to use a mix we can eat gluten but feel better when we do not made from scratch gf pancakes are not typically very good and this even beats it is competition with gluten i highly recommend trying this prices here are much better than stores ,1

having lost lbs in the past months on a low carb diet i use a number of weight loss products regularly these dark chocolate covered sunflower seeds are calories of rich chocolate flavor and surprisingly low carb you get oz per serving at the price i am tempted to buy them in bulk and measuring them out into snack bags of course the sealed nature of these little bags keep me from cheating see my other reviews for opinions on more low carb chocolate based diet meal replacement bars and snacks ,1
just ordered this off of amazon and it is an excellent product i have been buying this brand of nori for a few years now this batch was extremely fresh crunchy and greenish in color while that is awesome news it also showed me that some of the prior nori i bought last year was not the freshest stuff amazon sent me for some reason i want to say that this bulk bag has fresher nori than the count bags this also comes in a resealable bag so you do not have to eat all of it at once i will be buying this from now on instead of the or sheet bag much better value and reputable company this is sold from love the fact eden foods has not sold itself out to a bigger conglomerate and remains true to the organic natural movement excellent product and it comes from japan not china no offense to the chinese but i do not want any nori from china ,1
senseo vanilla was my favorite until i tried this one this has a stronger coffee flavor without being bitter now i use this one exclusively i would like a stronger taste of the creme brulee but none of the flavored coffees have a really strong sense of the flavoring no matter what they are called i do like the smell of the vanilla in the senseo but the coffee is better in the baronet ,1

i am very happy with my subscription honey is delicious and pure i think this is my third shipment and i have just increased it to packs a month since i can not get enough of it i go through pack of in about a week to a week and a half i know that is a lot of honey but oh well i put it in my tea as well the only problem is the packaging i am not sure if it is because of the air pressure that it actually bursts through but it leaks not that much though overall they do try to super pack it to avoid leaks but still happens it is not like a lot of the product leaks but it makes the rest of the packaging sticky make sure you are close to a sink when you are ready to open yours hope this helps have a honeyful day ,1
i love this coconut oil i use it on my face and body everyday and night i love the smell also very coconutty ,1
as a lifelong baker of all sorts of breads and other family recipes using regular flour when i unexpectedly developed an intolerance for gluten i thought it would be easy to find good recipes using substitute ingredients for the flour i spent a lot of time and money trying gf bread recipes i bought recipe books used all kinds of flours and was ultimately not satisfied with any of them the breads were crumbly or not a pleasing texture in the mouth or in the case of garbanzo bean flour bubbly in the tummy and forget the store bought gf breads what do they do to some of them that they last for months on the shelf and others that are kept in the store refrigerator seem dry and tasteless then i stumbled upon the namaste bread mix i love it bread that tastes smells and feels like a real bread i do make a few alterations to the package instructions i add a teaspoon of sugar to the yeast water mixture to boost the proofing sometimes i add caraway seeds and italian herbs to the dough or cinnamon a teaspoon c sugar and as soon as i take the bread hot out of the baking pan i butter or olive oil the top and wrap the whole loaf in aluminum foil to keep in the moisture while it cools then i slice the cooled bread put pieces of wax paper between the slices and freeze the loaf in a freezer bag that makes it easy to pop one slice at a time in the microwave for seconds served warm it is even more moist and tasty one of these days i am going to try making hamburger buns by baking the dough in small bowls this bread mix is easy and compared to buying gf bread in the stores or the price of amassing the various ingredients to try to make your own from scratch it is not all that expensive i buy it in boxes of from amazon because it is the best price by far that i have found anywhere ,1
this is a great product i love the keurig and green mountain breakfast blend is just right for me ,1
these ginger snaps are great they taste and look homemade the ginger flavor is strong but not overpowering the cookies have a crunchy texture i agree with the reviewer who compared the texture to biscotti so if you like your ginger snaps crunchy and with that pungent snap of ginger buy these ,1
can we preach about the merits of canned beets here this is not a fresh beet so you will not be happy if that is what you are looking for in a can this is canned and for being canned it is very good as i am cooking dinner i open a can of these to nibble on i do save a few to put on a plate for others for a burst of color on their dish i do not heat them just open the can drain and enjoy they are small and whole so they are tender and the best for a canned beet they do not need slicing since they are bite sized makes a perfect little snack i also eat the pickled whole beets from libby is straight out of the can for snacks instead of candy and i eat hole green beans for snacks again from the can hint put drained whole green beans into the pickled beet juice and marinade for a day ,1
love it when i can find convenient snacks and small meals that are gluten free and also taste good this tastes nothing at all like pad thai but it does have a good flavor ca not beat the price either ,1
when my yorkie was about years old her breath suddenly became extremely nasty i thought perhaps the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so i took her to the vet for her annual checkup the vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested i have her teeth cleaned at the price of over well before forking over the big bucks i thought i would try brushing her teeth myself and headed to petco to buy some doggie toothpaste i found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because spunky just loves her petco outings i let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of greenies after checking out a box i thought it was certinaly worth a shot so i bought a box of teenies for soon as we arrived home i attempted to brush her teeth the best that i could and then gave her one greenie she seemed to really enjoy it i typically buy everything on amazon so i jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was less than petco is i immediately ordered them from amazon and when that box arrived a day later i took that unopened box over to petco and returned it to them to get my back very sweet deal my dog is now a greenies addict with sweet breath again i should create a video review sometime because it is hilarious to see this little yorkie yelling for me outside of the pantry door she knows exactly where the greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a greenie i allow her to have two greenies per day and she seems to know that is her quota both spunky and i are very happy with greenies and will continue to buy them ,1
i am a really big fan of the jack link is peppered beef jerky but it can be hit or miss with the freshness this stuff was pretty good though i think the jack link is has a better taste due to more flavourings the secret is in the soy sauce they use i suspect where this has a cleaner beef taste which some might like more i think the beef strips in this brand are a bit too thick but maybe that is just me ,1

these are fantastic snacks and great to crumble up and put in yogurt if you eat them a lot buying in bulk definitely saves money ,1
my dogs like these the best and i am glad if it cleans their teeth i bought a for what i felt was a very reasonable price and will buy more hopefully for the same price i have two very picky eaters of food and treats a toy and a miniature poodle they turn down practically all treats offered them these are their favorite except for the gourmet duck treats from costco that i can not find anywhere else these are really worth buying ,1
if you are cringing at the cost i recommend you bite the bullet and give it a try i was very skeptical and agonized about the decision to order the first time thinking it was just too much to pay for flour but then gluten free products are always more expensive hopefully they will come down over time especially as more and more people go gluten free in the meantime i will happily pay a little extra for a better product this is by far the best flour blend i have used for baking and like most other gluten free bakers i have tried more flours than i care to remember this is great in pancakes and waffles joy of cooking recipes and i made my mom is traditional coffee cake recipe this morning and it was delicious however i do not necessarily use a one to one substitution i usually back off a quarter cup or so in a standard two cup recipe and like the texture better but that may just be personal taste i would definitely recommend experimenting with the quantities though to get it just the way you like it it is good in cookies but to me it shines best in the more leavened baked goods pancakes waffles breads and cakes again that might just be personal taste but i have found certain blends work better for different types of foods bread vs frying vs baked goods so we have experimented a ton and keep around several different blends for different types of cooking this is definitely my go to blend for baking ,1
i bought because i was afraid one would not work or i would kill one accidentally it is not that much more since you have to pay shipping anyway total came out to both starters did fine and i have had months of tasty sourdough now the only thing i am sad about is that my sourdough is probably more madison now than san francisco i do not know my palate expertise is not good enough to recognize authentic sourdough this really has nothing to do with the efficacy of the product ,1

excellent product this is the chai used at my local coffee tea establishments saves me money by making my own these sell for each when i purchase from my favorite baristas ,1
what can i say this stuff is great if you are like me and can not handle really spicy foods then do not use a full packet of the spice that comes in each bowl i usually only use half of one then give the rest to whoever wants to add it to theirs a full bag is pretty spicy but if you tone it down some to taste should you choose to do that then it is really good stuff a friend of mine introduced me to it a few months back and honestly i can not get enough i would definitely reccomend this to anybody who likes noodle soups in a cup the spice makes the flavor of it but like i said you do not have to use the whole packet that comes with it ,1
great way to start my day end my day start end a workout love this stuff i lived in brazil for years and this stuff is the closest to the real thing thanks ,1
there are a few things that i cannot live without and good thai food is on my short list since learning to cook a few thai dishes at home i have been in search of rice noodles that taste like what i can get from my local thai restaurants and these are exactly what i wanted their flavor is fantastic i can not really quantify exactly what it is about them vs others that i have tried but they just taste better period if you are looking for an authentic thai noodle that works for pad thai or stir frying you can not go wrong with these ,1
a coworker told me about this product she bought at the health food store so i went and bought one and it was love at first bite these are so good you can not believe it even my mother likes it and she never likes these nutrition type of bars now she will finally snack a little healthier i never buy anything online in this quantity after only one initial purchase so that should tell you and i bought qty i love the fact that they are easier on your teeth they are not hard they are soft the only other type of nutrition bars i liked before were the kind bars and these blow kind bars away i will use this as a healthy snack the only thing bad about these is the sugar for diabetics since you should not go over grams of sugar in one serving this is all you can get as they are per bar ,1

those searching high and low for salt that will change their life can end their journey with murray river sea salt i first stumbled on this salt at a local outlet of a cultlike nationwide chain store that pretends to sell only the highest quality foods but also happily lends its imprimatur to made in china foods that sometimes turn out to be tainted but ignoring other controversies associated with that store one day a package of this salt sold by that store stirred my interest which led to the salt completing the last step of its long and probably ecologically unsound trip from australia to my kitchen here is the thing about murray river salt its pinkish flakes are fragile and crumble easily in your fingers it also seems to dissolve almost immediately on contact with food this is in sharp contrast to every other salt i have tried we currently have or other kinds of coarse crystal salt in the house none of them can be crushed in your fingers they remain large hard chunks of salt yes they represent other flavors than the murray river salt but there is something gentle and friendly about this salt i have a totally unsubstantiated theory that this salt is better for your body than the hardened crystals of other salts our household keeps murray river salt in a salt cellar in our case a small lidded wooden bowl from which it is pinched with the fingers instead of using the traditional tiny spoon and crumbled directly onto food on the plate for sanitary reasons only a small amount of the salt at a time is put in the bowl that way the bowl gets cleaned frequently frequent cleaning seems like a necessity when fingers even washed ones are the tools of choice for dispensing the salt words to the wise if you invite nose pickers to your table provide a salt shaker and hide the murray river stuff till they have left if you have small children in your home wait until they are grown and are draining your bank account at the safe distance of some far off college before purchasing and placing this salt on your table another reviewer mentioned that they use this as a finishing salt our household concurs we rarely if ever add this salt to anything in the cooking process we keep kosher salt and a couple of sea salts for most larger salt use cooking needs like baking which frankly seems like the only time one should add much salt to the cooking process but this is the good stuff for your table and the food you serve on it the chain store mentioned above no longer carries this salt so amazon is the logical alternative note that i purchased a bag which keeps well because i live in a desert but next time i will probably purchase a multi pack of the smallest bags for a small amount more per unit weight in exchange for the convenience of having smaller packages ,1
you can purchase green mountain half cafe at bed bath beyond and walmart for for be sure to check your local stores ,1

i just got the padfilter and the first time i tried it the coffee was a little weak but that was my fault because i packed the coffee in there after that i filled it but with room to spare to better understand fill it and close it if you can shake it and hear the coffee moving around then you have it right after doing it that way from the second time on i have had one great cup after another and yes you do get the creamy foam i have been using starbucks sumatra and it comes out tasting great the only reason for not giving it stars because if you have a big mug you have to fill both pods and run the machine twice but that is just me ,1
i do not drink coffee anymore i feel better drinking this tea is delicius and healthy ,1

i truly love the stem ginger in syrup most particularly during the thanksgiving and christmas holidays for those of you that like to provide a dish that is different from standard fare this is the foodstuff to use my main reason for purchasing the stem ginger in syrup is for a sweet potato recipe i shall put my recipe below take one to two pieces of the stemmed ginger and mince into many tiny pieces be patient and do this in a frying pan put a quarter pound or one stick of butter sautee this mixture until good and hot and let the flavor infuse the butter one family size can of sweet potatos yams however they are called you can find them at holiday time already spiced most specially with cinnamon etc take your casserole and place well drained sweet potatos and mash them with a fork lightly pour your mixture of stem ginger butter over the potatos and add about a cup of brown sugar stir to mix well but do not do it so heavily that you no longer have chunks of the sweet potato pop into the oven at about degrees and let bake until the dish is very hot you might even see a little bubbling around the pan a marvelous side to any holiday meal this is intensley sweet almost like a desert it is clearly high in sugar and butter but once or twice a year will do little harm enjoy ,1

i purchased this for making fudge i made batches one using the callebaut dark chocolate and one using bakers brand chocolate in my unscientific blind taste test out of people preferred the callebaut the other preferred the bakers all said the callebaut was smoother and creamier but most said the bakers was more chocolaty the callebaut was easier to measure and use i did not have to chop it up for quicker melting maybe using a mixture of each will produce the quality between smoothness and chocolate that i want ,1

this coffee smells a bit like starbuck is breakfast blend but it does not taste anywhere near as strong which in my opinion is preferred there is not however any guidance whatsover on the box regarding preparation thus when i made my first mug of marley coffee i was not sure how much water i was supposed to use or how much time i was supposed to wait so i chucked in two packets and let them steep for two minutes the result tasted fine not the best i would ever had but good enough for a sample run my second go with the coffee was a bit more involved but met with better brewing results my household had run out of ground coffee so i cut open several marley packets to use in our,1

my wife and i have both been using labrada is products for the past year we originally started with the lean body shakes but soon found the prov was cheaper when purchased in bulk like this the vanilla is very versatile and we get rather creative with our shake flavors by adding fruit chocolate or between the two of us we have lost and built some serious muscle i have tried other brands but i always come back to labrada because i get exactly what i expect and nothing that i do not want we recommend this protein to all of our friends at the gym and my wife is personal training clients ,1

i have made every effort to not buy feed anything made in china to my pet i researched these duck sweet potato treats before finally deciding to buy them nowhere on the amazon product page does it tell you where these treats are made so i searched for the smokehouse website which claimed that only some of their chicken treats contained chicken from china but all other products are made in the usa so i felt safe in purchasing these duck sweet potato treats after opening a bag and giving them to my dog did i glance at the product origin needless to say my dog likes them very much but i was not happy to find product of china on the bag boo hiss to amazon for not putting the product origin on the product page and to smokehouse for misleading consumers on their product information website why do they do this because there are customers just like me that care where the product originates many of you may not be concerned about this but i am and i think it is very misleading not to provide accurate and complete information about the product when purchasing from an internet store at least the product does not smell like plastic like the dingo products i will not be purchasing these again my dog seemed to like them but she will not be getting anymore of them i took a star off due to the lack of complete information from amazon and misleading information from smokehouse update big thumbs up to amazon for great customer service when i called to return this item they were very helpful in processing a refund and because it is considered a grocery item i did not even have to return the items i had also purchased the smokehouse duck chips but they too are made in china i suggested the addition of the country of origin to both product pages just another reason why i do not hesitate to purchase from amazon they truly have great customer service rare these days ,1
this is a good way i have found to help add a little flavor to the veggies that i am supposed to be getting every day it is pretty low in calories and tastes very good the only thing that i would caution on is that it is pretty high on the sodium side if you are worried about your sodium intake there are better options than this in that department ,1
i put them in the refrigerator for a sweet treat now but will put them in my back for school ,1
this stuff is just plain disgusting i am so glad i found it at my grocery store and tried a box before i ordered a case from amazon as i normally do with cereal as another poster said where did they get the picture that appears on the box that is certainly not their product just gross ,0
i tried a can of seabear smoked pacific oysters when i ordered some other stuff directly from seabear i loved the oysters and when i found them on amazon the price was really good especially with the subscription the oysters are caught in the northwest usa and smoked i appreciate seabear and their standards used in catching their fish i feel good supporting usa fishermen instead of smoked oysters from thailand or some other place these oysters have no oil added and are actually really smoked i eat them directly out of the can and the cans are super easy to open no can opener required they make a great snack and oysters are also high in the mineral zinc i am not huge on shell fish but these are definitely worth getting very happy with the price at amazon as they are a can elsewhere and i really can not afford that as much as i like these the cans are packed full of smoked oysters and big enough to serve a couple people a snack or use in a recipe i want to try a can in a pasta dish ,1

my husband and i love the coffee bags they brew the perfect cup of coffee every time my husband who drinks his black insists it has a dark chocolate kind of flavor i just love the fact that it does not taste like brewed coffee i am so spoiled on these bags i do not drink any type of brewed coffee now in fairness i cannot compare this to the taste of the keurig coffee pod because i have not tried that yet but i am able to compare the price it seems that the best price i have seen runs around per cup of coffee for the keurig this is approximately per bag i drink a cup in the morning and one in the afternoon i am shocked these have not had more marketing ,1
it is not have a bitter taste as a few have suggested i always use a melitta cup for making any espresso coffee and this one is just delicious i checked my ph strip and it does not register as acid it does not bother my stomach at all and i am super sensitive to anything acid american coffee i have a hard time tolerating the italian and kenya coffees that are dark roast espresso are thought by some people via their processing techniques and quality to be alkaline it makes the american coffee look like junk for how the body responds and the taste once you have had this coffee you will not want american coffee anymore in case anyone is wondering what a melitta cup is it is a cone made from plastic or ceramic mine is ceramic and it has a hole at the bottom i adjust the coffee filter to fit it and then put the espress coffee in it and then pour my hot water from the tea kettle into it i add a little nut milk into the coffee and i am ready to enjoy a wonderful taste it beats dealing with a coffee maker any day each person in the family can have their own melitta cup as it is so quick to do ,1
i am not a fan of drinking water however because of dehydration issues my doctor is always on me about drinking more i have tried lots of other water additives from mio drops to crystal light powders and everything in between i have not had much luck with many other flavorings because i do not like the chemical after tastes that many of them have with that said i was pleasantly surprised by these vitamin squeeze drops first the bottle is huge it is so much larger than the mio and similar products bottles that are also available i was pleased to see that there was no caffeine or sugar in it and it also has lots of vitamins most pleasing was the fact that when i drank water with it there was no nasty after taste as for it being an energy drink i did not notice any marked increase in my energy but that was not an issue for me since that was not what i was looking for however since i did not notice an increase in my energy i was not able to give this item stars on the other hand it has really helped me to increase my water intake which makes me my kidneys and my doctor very happy i will continue to purchase and use this product ,1

i just spent a month in italy and got hooked on illy brewed in a standard drip filter coffee maker i used coffee spoons for a pot once i got the right ratio i found the coffee full bodied and sweet without acidity i am glad i brought a couple of cans back from italian grocery stores it costs double here keep in mind that it is canned coffee so do not expect it to be as robust as fresh roasted from your local coffee shop but if you like to experiment with different coffees give it a try it is packaged in a nicely designed can with a screw on top that seals pretty well ,1

the peach flavor of knudsen spritzers is one of their best i also recommend strawberry and mango fandango the soda does not contain any added sugar or other undesirables while the main juice is not peach juice most of their spritzers are predominantly grape or apple juices it does have enough peach juice to give it a distinct peach flavor some people may find these spritzers a little too sweet i like to drink mine with ice or a little seltzer added i have tried other competing brands and find these spritzers the best all juice sodas out there ,1
the package arrived promptly and there was an unusual assortment of flavors inside i bought this for the unit night nurses and it was nearly gone by the morning i came back and bought another along with a full box of breakfast blend for the more traditional coffee drinkers ,1
we have a vegetable garden tomatoes cucumber basil parsley rosemary and mint i have seen woodchucks deer and a groundhog munching on my garden we have tried several things in the past to deter them the rosemary actually worked to deter the deer but the woodchucks and groundhog kept coming back this stuff smells terrible like a very strong black pepper we shook it around the perimeter of our x garden we reapply after each rainstorm after a week of use we have not seen any more woodchucks or groundhogs they were previously daily visitors so i would say that this works however it need to be reapplied often certainly after any rain it is quite an expensive solution ,1
these are really good and have a great flavor there is a little more than one serving in each bag but i usually do not eat the whole bag in one sitting low calorie and low fat also would buy these again for sure ,1
we put them on soup salad eat as a snack they are a new favorite in our house and make soup look like something from a fancy restaurant ,1
this salt wakes up your taste buds and creates a buttery salty mushroomy flavor that will not disappoint it is a must buy ,1
i am on weight watchers and these chips are only points and they taste great i like every kind i use the plain chips to dip with my salsa i would recomend these chips to everyone weight watchers or not ,1
i bought this as a gag gift for my husband but the funny thing is it really works it is very cool i doubt it will get a lot of use by us but i think kids would love it especially if they like shooting guns good stocking stuffer ,1
hemp is the only protein smoothie i will make and drink nothing else on the market does what this does for the body ,1
i can not make a panini without using this olive salad it adds so much flavor and makes the sandwiches special with very little work my daughter lives in shreveport and i found this in a small local grocery bringing it home was never simple and now with the airline restrictions it is almost impossible thank you amazon for making this authenic louisiana food available ,1
i bought this because amazon was out of the two leaves a bud assam which is my favorite this has a good clean flavor slightly earthy smokey with some lighter notes flowery since it is whole leaf tea i find it less bitter and has a fuller flavor than most bagged darjeeling tea if you like a bold morning cup of black tea this might not be the one for you however it is lighter than the assam or english irish breakfast types and i prefer the darjeeling as an early afternoon tea ,1
these are great as soon as i opened the bag i could not stop eating low in calories was a plus ,1
i absolutely love these i have a lb mini aussie who is notorious for devouring things that should take him days or weeks to chew through in a matter of a couple hours i decided to try these after trying a different dental bone that lasted days these looked harder so i had high hopes it took about minutes to get him started chewing on the bone i am not sure if it did not smell like food or if he was just unsure about the density but after that he was hooked he chews on it quite often but it is lasted weeks and he is still got about of the first one left the best part about these are that they really freshened his breath he is always had a breath problem it just stinks but these bones have made it perfectly tolerable they have also cleaned his teeth although not as much as i would hoped hence the star rating instead of however i do not expect a bone to take up all the slack in hygiene so i am quite content letting it freshen his breath and still getting his teeth cleaned regularly ,1
i have been drinking this tea since i gave birth and never had a problem with not enough milk i think this might have helped plus it good tastes ,1
this tea and the brand has been the top quality i was searching for the tea is delicious and very fresh i will go so far as to say it is the most delicious tea i have tasted i was impressed how quickly the tea was shipped ,1
straight up it is a little tart but still tastes good i got this for my joints but i have found that it gives a lot of flavor to diet soda for a lot fewer calories and more vitamins than normal soda i also use it mixed with a little oil and vinegar for a great salad dressing it can also be mixed with a little balsamic vinegar for a delicious sauce for chicken or pork i can not tell you how many people have asked for my chicken recipe when i use it as an ingredient in a glaze while grilling and being a concentrate it takes up a lot less space in comparison to buying several quarts worth of unconcentrated cherry juice this stuff is amazing ,1
i was thrilled to have received these in the mail i used to eat these on a regular basis when i lived in california however these are impossible to open i mean to have the candy come out you have to press hard and use a lotta force to get the candy to push out so i would say maybe not as fresh as i would like after one i basically gave up i did not feel like a refund was necessary i was just disappointed ,0
these easy packets taste so good they are cheaper than the jelly belly brand if you just want to try them out and trust me they taste way better i love all the flavors ,1
bought this because other reviewers highly rated comments and it is as close to the real thing but make sure you mix it good and a blender works best chill it and its awesome add more or less to your liking ,1
finally a quick easy prepackaged snack i can feel good about feeding my kids and it is almost mess free absolutely perfect thank you ,1
i am so happy that i purchased this cat food because my cat absolutely loved it i gave him half the can for his first meall and the rest later which really saved me money i will definitely purchase more in the near future ,1
i would not say i am a gourmet coffee kind of person but this is one of the best tasting coffees i have ever had i do not particulary care for strong coffee and this coffee is really smooth without losing flavor or tasting watered down ok i have purchased barney is coffees starbucks there are four of them within ten minutes from where i live and subscribed to gevalia for a while i can always add the fancy flavors with the cream but this is the best basic brew i have can remember worth the asking price highly recommend i did not even know what low acid meant until i tasted my first cup if you have a bad stomach i guess that is important i just go for the smooth taste just too bad you can not click on one of the little arrows like you do in the music department to get a second sample ,1
the vanilla is pleasant enough but it still has that stevia aftertaste i am going back to sugar in moderation of course ,1
great kippers great taste right amount of salt although i do get to buy these i have found out from my local grocer for still worth the buy ,1
i use these things for everything from soups to rice to broth substitutes the flavor is soft not sharp or bitter or pungently salty and you really taste the seasoning flavors rather than a nice glob of msg nastiness highly recommended and yes i purchase a whole case of these bad boys i have given some packages away as gifts to friends and they equally enjoyed them i will not use salty canned broth ever again ,1
i do not drink a lot of herbal tea except for peppermint flavor as i have a sensitive stomach an peppermint tea has always seemed to sooth my upset stomach the problem is that although i have tried different brands i have found that some are just too strong leaving me with heartburn in addition to a not so perfect tummy this brand higgins and burke seems to be the perfect choice for not as strong as some other peppermint extremely pleasant no heartburn or belching after effectwould definitely recomment this one ,1
apparently the original twix peanut butter pb bar has been discontinued and was replaced with this inferior version i guess at least a couple of years ago wish i had known that before ordering these bars yet another perfectly good product needlessly messed up by the manufacturer this version has a dark chocolate cookie which i guess is okay but it does not taste near as good to my tastebuds as the original pb bar with the standard cookie i guess i will have to look for something else the next time i get a peanut butter candy cookie urge that needs satisfying again for whatever reasons companies just can never seem to leave well enough alone go figure ,0
though it is not the diet version of sodastream ginger ale this concentrate still has a strong taste of artificial sweetener i was disappointed enough in the taste that after the first glass i threw out the remaining syrup ,0
finally a really tasty bar thats all natural and does not have soy or artificial stuff in it plus it is high in fiber i am always looking for a bar to carry in my bag when i am out in the field and just need something to keep me going but i do not want something i feel guilty about eating no bar can replace a good healthy meal but sometimes you just need something to hold you over the battle is always coming across bars that taste awful have the texture of wall plaster or have artificial sweetener and flavorings soy or too much sugar etc but here is one i feel good about eating it has a moist but firm texture and tastes mostly of cocoa with a bit of cinnamon with a very satisfying texture of whole oats nuts and raisins but is not too sweet i like these bars far better then any other brand i have tried they taste like something i would make myself i can not wait to try the other flavors but i would buy the oatmeal raisin again for sure i really like this product and it does not put me in a sugar crash thanks eat think smile great product all bars are a bit of a trade off depending on your personal needs some are looking for high protein low carb bars this is not one of them some do not like artificial bars some no fat some want a meal replacement etc here is the package info and ingredients below judge for yourself if these are right for fat whole wheat flour and whole grain corn flour brown sugar rolled oats chicory root extract canola oil dextrose walnuts raisins cocoa brown rice syrup glycerin nonfat milk less of eggs mono and diglycerides cornstarch salt cinnamon bking pwdr natural flavor milk ,1
i have found this chocolate to be a great solution for my low carbohydrate diet this chocolate only has net carbs per serving but i find half a serving to be plenty satisfying for a chocolate fix also this has no artificial sweeteners so i do not have to worry about digestive problems if you do not like dark chocolate you will not like this but if you are willing to savor the cocoa flavor this is a great way to eat a small amount of chocolate without a lot of sugar ,1
while this sampler has a wide variety of bold flavored coffees half of the them are decaf if you drink coffee for a pick me up in the morning like i do and require a healthy dose of caffeine try a different sampler ,0
these chips which are made from different vegetables besides potatoes are great if you want a different type of potato chip however do not be fooled like me into thinking they are a healthy snack they are made the way regular potato chips are fried in oil so if you are not loooking for health food you ought to try them ,1
purchased this product to make a bridal shower cake and though i have not used this product yet i know it is going to be perfect for what i need it for would buy from this seller again ,1
the perfect thing to just fill a spot without resorting to something less heathful ,1
nothing against the prior reviewer who does not believe this is the original oi ocha but i must say though as a repeat buyer both of these oz bottles from amazon as well as liter imports straight from japan the two are identical every now and then i feel like having the stronger oi ocha koi aji not sold by amazon as of the time of this review so i am familiar with it as well i have uploaded three photos comparing the packaging as well as closeups of exactly fl oz of each the prior reviewer is pic has ice no listed amount and appears to be far darker than the koi aji he believes it is hopefully this will help folks decide for themselves as for me i will just keep on drinking my favorite beverage on to the actual review for informational purposes most of the bottled green tea sold in the us is nothing like real green tea it is essentially tea flavored kool aid with ingredients that have no business being there do not expect oi ocha to taste anything like these beverages and you will not be disappointed mellow and ever so slightly nutty oi ocha is flavor is delicate subtle and amazingly refreshing drink it as cold as possible and store unused portions in the refrigerator after opening left out and oxidized it turns dark and the taste goes bad i have a theory that this is what the prior reviewer may have inadvertently done it does not have a single calorie and contains of your daily value of vitamin c per serving but i do not drink it because it happens to be healthy i drink it because it tastes so very very good oi ocha is the best ,1
i used these for a craft at christmas time they came quickly and were exactly as i expected worked excellent for what i needed them for and at this price i still was able to make a profit,1
this is an excellent product and worth every cent they are good for you too as has been seen ondr oz program ,1
my children just love these and the multi pack is so nice for them they take them as snacks almost every day to school the price was great good quality and arrived quickly ,1
these are the best brownies ever i wanted to eat all of the first batch i made right away i have never tasted any brownies that has come close ,1
i am skeptical about the health claims of these cookies that said i eat them because they are crunchy and rich and delicious without being too high in calories the chocolate ones are my favorite these are really good ,1
makes a great cup of coffee as others have written and i particularly enjoy making iced coffee with it i fill a cup with ice and brew the small size on my model it stops brewing just in time with a full glass just enough room for a little cream price was decent and received quickly ,1
great flavor for the bucks oz can satisfy your fish diet i will recommend this product to everyone you can season it a little bit to get your favorite taste it is not salty at all ,1
i just wanted to start by responding to some of the claims made here firstly you do not need to be a particular nationality or type of person to like marmite that is just ridiculous secondly it is not a cultural thing to enjoy savory or umami foods any more than it is cultural to like sweet sour bitter or salty flavors you either like it or you do not does everyone like double fudge ice cream incredibly no i find marmite delicious but potent i think many times people do not enjoy it because they have eaten a gob straight from the jar or they spread it like jam that is too much try it spread very thinly or add a small dollop to your savory sauces and stocks i highly recommend trying it you may love it if not at least admit it is a matter of preference rather than rant like a xenophobic donkey is rump ,1
i love huckleberries and luckily the first huckleberry coffee i tasted was wonderful usually i do not like flavored coffee so huckleberry coffee is an exception unfortunately some i have had after that have been disappointing after the first delightful one i tasted this one did not disappoint and i am so glad i ordered it highly recommended for any coffee lover that wants a different delicious flavor ,1
once upon a time one could purchase toffee bits in grocery stores i have used brickle bits in muffin recipes for pie crusts over ice cream then at one point stores stopped carrying the toffee bits you can get the heath bar variety but there are times when just plain old toffee bits are called for amazon to the rescue after having searched every grocery store in the seattle area i looked online and there they were toffee bits just waiting for me to order i have more brickle bits than i know what to do with now so i have given a few bags away i gave one to a woman i work with a few days ago just on a whim oh my god she cried out i have been looking for this everywhere she was making a pumpkin toffee cheesecake it was nice to bring such great joy with such a small thing i hope amazon continues to carry these toffee bits as soon as it looks like i may be running low i will put in another order ,1
if you are wanting to try sardines with a delicious flavor and are out of the ordinary this is it these are by far the best sardines i have had and i look forward to ordering more to save for those special moments when i want my sardines to have flavor they are not too hot and the laurel and clove spices are so sensual for a can of sardines and puts these above all the other brands i love ,1
if i had to point out a flaw in this variety pack it would be that there is no light flavor i e green tea to round out the mix short of that i can not imagine anything i would complain about with this mix english breakfast strong dark and goes well with a dash of milk if that is your thing a solid way to wake up any day irish breakfast it is hard to say this blend tastes lighter than the english but it makes you feel lighter great with a full irish breakfast the irish blend really makes you happy to meet the day earl grey twinings brand actually bears the seal of the or an earl of grey and it is probably the best earl you can get from a bag great for any occasion especially for star trek nerds like me who can not help but chuckle and mumble earl grey hot with every mug lady grey a remarkable inclusion lady grey is based on the earl flavor whereas the earl tastes of deep orange the lady has a very light dash of lemon lady grey is an excellent and complex treat good for relaxing or just plain enjoying your tea lady grey is light and aromatic without being a gimmick tea like so many other brands are willing to push this is a serious tea and yet it still has a sense of fun this mix has it all you have got your strong standby flavors that are great in the morning english and irish you have got a great anytime flavor the earl and a superb treat flavor the lady short of making the jump to looseleaf tea you just can not find better flavors than this ,1
these are amazing every which way dipped in tea plain at room temp and my favorite way chilled yum yum yum ,1
i have tried eating this a few times over the years but always seem to have an allergic reaction to it also it has an odd sweet taste that is unappealing ,0
this is a bit milder flavour and more fruity acidic than the qualita rossa which i also really like i would maybe choose the rossa over this one for lattes etc cuz it has a bit more body to stand out in the milk but for straight espresso and when i am in a mellower mood inblu is great excellent value in the,1
my local grocery no longer carries this product so of course i turned to amazon i do not know how good the other flavors are but as an addict of cranberries yum these are super crispy biscotti which is how i like the ,1
i know that coffee reviews are subjective we all have different tastes and preferences right so i am writing my review based on my own preferences for a light roast coffee with a soft flavor rather than overly bitter or bold this is currently my absolutely favorite k cup flavor while it is brewing i get the distinct aroma of cinnamon rolls i brew in a keurig and choose the serving size and think the brew strength is exactly right my usual method of serving is to heat about ounces of skim milk in the microwave for minute add about tablespoon sf torani vanilla syrup and froth using my aerolatte thingie then i add the coffee to the milk and stir gentle it is as good as anything i can get at starbucks ,1
mcvitie is chocolate digestive biscuits have been popular dunked in tea in the uk since but are somewhat hard to find in the u s the taste of the cookie is quite similar to a graham cracker although the texture is more similar to shortbread the dark chocolate version is much better than the milk chocolate ones as the cookies themselves are not too sweet these are not dainty cookies but everyone seems to like them especially children two cookies makes a nice treat with a glass of milk or a cup of tea coffee or chocolate if you enjoy graham crackers shortbread and chocolate you should like these as well my only complaint is with the packaging as they tend to stick together during the summer when the chocolate gets a bit gooey the grab go cans also have lids that do not fit very well at all ingredients wheat flour dark chocolate flavored coating sugar chocolate vegetable oil contains one or more of the following shea illipe sal palm mango kernel kokum cocoa butter butter oil soy lecithin polyglycerol polyricinoleate natural flavor palm oil whole wheat flour sugar glucose syrup leavening sodium bicarbonate and ammonium bicarbonate malic acid tartaric acid salt calcium carbonate reduced iron nicotinamide thiamine hydrochloride nutrition facts per cookie calories from fat fat gsaturated fat gcholesterol mgsodium mgtotal carbohydrate gdietary fiber less than gsugar gprotein g,1

i am from the midwest and my job transfer to me to the south for the past few years i have always had this sweet baby ray in my years of cooking the there no other barbecue i would use my family and i look in each local store to find tiny small bottles that was way over priced with our adventure to the south we are finding out that amazon carry alot products we are use too again this is my baby ray saucue and would have it any other way ,1
ok so it is not exactly ice cream but it scratches that itch i can sit down and eat a whole pint of this stuff for only calories i love that i have read mixed reviews some like this stuff others hate it i love it i want to try the cookies and cream next that said it is very expensive so i only purchase now and then so it will not be for awhile ,1
so we had a membership with costco and got addicted to this brand of coffee it is about the best stuff i have had when you make it with a toddy maker cold brewing system i have no idea why i have tried our local coffee roasters different brands and roasts from whole foods and a number of other sources for beans but it is like these are made to be cold brewed great shipping as usual from amazon nice low acid notes with just a hint of vanilla in the background give it a shot if you have not before ,1
love these much better than wheat thins or any competitors less salt better crunch highly recommend these and they are a pretty healthy snack too have not loved anything this much since candy ,1
prior to this purchase i had been a staunch supporter of dog nips brand previously free range brand chicken wrapped apple treats and perhaps it is just this particular merchant that sold me old outdated dog treats but in any case they made both my dog my parent is dog puke only after both dogs became sick did i closely inspect the bags for an expiration date the only thing i could find was an imprint on the front that said lot i took this as an expiration date of march i just recently bought the treats in october so they were very outdated when i received them the chicken had indeed appeared somewhat darker in color than other bags i have bought in the past but i did not think a whole lot of it after the dogs became sick however i felt i had to discontinue feeding them to our dogs bags approximately down the drain i was very unhappy with the purchase and i would not recommend ever buying doog food or treats online because of this experience ,0
i got this at cotsco for bucks they are authentic jelly belly jelly beans i can not believe some people are doubting that the kirkland signature is owned by cotsco they would never do that as they are a very respected brand any who i agree that there are some spit em out quick like someone said before but also i agree that they are many tasty flavors as well and it is for a great value here are the list of the flavors and the ones i consider to be spit em out quick flavors i also gave them a grade of a through f i am testing every flavor while i write the review keep in mind that everyone has different preference and taste if you flavors that you really like and i really like it too then the grades will help a lot since it will probable mean we have slightly same taste if vice versa then there is nothing to see other than which flavors you are going to get berry blue a my favorite cappuccino b it is a hate it or love it flavor i like it it tastes like the coffee mints cotton candy agreen apple alemon drop amargarita apina colada ared apple cstrawberry daiquiri dblueberry ccaramel corn spit em out quick fa w cream soda cisland punch b taste like tutti frutti lemon lime amixed berry smoothie asunkist pink grapefruit aa w root beer c it is not as bad as it seems strawberry jam atutti frutti bbubble gum a i am not a big fan of this flavor but it really tastes like bubble gun chocolate pudding acrushed pineapple ajuicy pear a it really tastes like pear licore spit em out quick f not a surprise sunkist orange aplum bsizzling cinnamon a it has a spicy hint to it sunkist tangerine avery cherry abuttered popcorn spit em out quick f it really taste like popcorn i am a popcorn lover but who wants that taste in a jelly bean cinnamon a the same as sizzling cinnamon but stronger dr pepper dkiwi asunkist lime aorange sherbet bpomegranate bsour cherry btoasted marshmallow spit em out quick fcantaloupe acoconut a it tastes just like coconut french vanilla dsunkist lemon amango apeach araspberry astrawberry cheesecake btop banana awild blackberry b be careful you can easily confuse it with licore ,1
i love this salt it imparts an intense smoke and salt seasoning flavor to whatever you are putting it on i paid dollars for the three tins and found it to be pricey but worthy and unique i do not think i would pay dollars for it though unless you think it critical for a recipe i smoke my own foods but i would not smoke with this salt on anything if you grill on a gas barbeque then this may help you achieve smoky flavor and saltiness at the same time it is good for other foods cooked indoors as well again if you barbeque with wood then you might not need this at all i recommend using this on fish i also suggest you have a salt grinder as the granules are to the larger size type of salt crystal and reducing it in size helps to avoid heavily salted spots and spread out the flavor evenly ,1
the most wonderful bulgarian feta cheese i have ever purchased this cheese is a good as the french valbreso that is available in the can but at a fraction of the cost do not be fooled by domestic feta bulgarian feta is smooth and creamy and one of the best brands in the world ,1
the product is labeled as having zero grams trans fat but it also has partially hydrogenated coconut or palm kernel sic on the online ingredient list as of nov note that partially hydrogenated oil is trans fat the law in the united states allows them to claim zero grams if they have milligrams or less i will quote from the following articlemozaffarian et al trans fatty acids and cardiovascular disease the new england journal of medicine volume pages explain why this is really terrible i quote from page of this article however the producers of foods that contain lessthan mg of trans fatty acids per serving willbe allowed to list the content of trans fatty acidsas on the packaging so even consumers whoread the labels might unwittingly consume substantialamounts of trans fats in multiple servings for example several pats of margarine orseveral cookies per day here are a few more quotations from this article given the million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths fromchd coronary heart disease in the united near elimination ofindustrially produced trans fats might avert percent and percent chd events i e heart attacks each year these estimates are based on the replacementof trans fats with carbohydrates in practice however trans fats in partially hydrogenated oilswould most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated cis unsaturated which may haveadditional potential benefits as compared withcarbohydrates if such additional potential benefitis considered greater proportions of chdevents to percent might be averted note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans fat is astonishing since the authors point on on the first page that trans fat makes up only of the american diet in terms of calories and fat is high in calories the average consumption of industrially produced transfatty acids in the united states is to percent of total calories consumed they conclude on the basis of evidence from in vitro experimentalstudies dietary trials and prospective observationalstudies the consumption of trans fattyacids from partially hydrogenated oils providesno apparent nutritional benefit and has considerablepotential for harm professor willett has also written extensively about trans fat for a general audience in his book eat drink and be healthy the harvard medical school guide for healthy eating ,0
i have gotten gift tins of cookies before and most had that artificial something has been added to make these stay fresh taste the delecre cookies had none of that and so much real chocolate goodness the best tin of cookies i have ever eaten lots of subtle varietythat kept me nibbling i plan to order some more since my gift tin from christmas is almost depleted ,1
mild but definite coconut flavor here i use instead of butter on toast vegies rice cakes etc not good for frying except eggs no crispy browning contains medium chain amino acids that works wonders on brain neuron connections for alshiemers and weaned babies lack of these may even be a factor in causing autism olive and other oils have none non hydrogenated ,1
i still prefer grinding my own whole bean coffee but for a pre ground flavored coffee this is probably the best i have had the vanilla flavor is just right not too over powering like many flavored coffees instead it has just the right level of vanilla the only issue is that you do not need the amount of coffee that is suggested you can probably get by with half of the amount of coffee and still enjoy a great cup of joe ,1
i am a type diabetic for years i have always had spikes in my blood sugar whenever i ate pasta pizza too i watched an episode of dr oz last year and really thought this stuff would taste like crap how often does healthy things taste good lol did i mention that i am italian and that i grew up in nyc i cannot eat crappy pizza or pasta i figured i would give this a try and go right back to my semolina pasta after the first taste test i was completely amazed that i really enjoy this pasta and what i enjoy even more than eating it is how it does not make my blood sugar difficult to control i actually take less insulin to cover this pasta then i had to with the semolina if you are diabetic and would like a great tasting pasta that does not make your blood sugar spike then try this pasta i am certain that you will see a difference it is also a lot healthier than semolina too ,1
the folgers k cups lively blend is a great product we have tried several k cups and truly enjoy the flavor of this one i will continue to purchase ,1
once you have had this oatmeal you will not want to go back to any other highly recommend this ,1
of all the coffee is i have bought this was the most dissappointing it is just instant coffee in a k cup in my opinion it was a total rip off do not by these unless you are a big fan of instant coffee ,0
i recently tried the,1
i have a son who is milk intolerant he really likes this product much more than soy milk it is a thin tasting substitute for milk the boxes were packaged in a strong cardboard box and arrived in excellent condition the price at the time i bought them was less than a box which was better than in the stores in my area i imagine the price fluctuates online more than in the store ,1
this chamo spearmint combo killer is both a powerful mind enhancer and your soothing masseuse of the night your mind will buzz at the optimal i q levels while your body will experience an erotic meltdown second great affordable price third tiny complaint packages sealed too tight you can not open them by hand and scissors make mistakes so might end up loosing the tailpiece but that is being nitty picky ,1
these seed taste really good i wish they were a little bigger if they were i would have given them a rather than enjoy ,1
i normally can not stand instant mash potatoes but these are the best my wife is even a potato snob and she thinks these are great as well creamy easy to make full flavor with no funny processed taste i have even made them low cal with just water and while not as good as the version with milk still outstanding get them ,1
was unhappy with the flavor i ordered under the assumption that the coffee would be the same quality that i have so enjoyed in restaurants i will not be re ordering this particular product if any one has ordered any douwe egbert product that meets the quality that is in restaurants please let me know there must be something that is out there thanks ,0
the price has gone up two times since october and if it continues it will price itself right out of being affordable while i like these gummies increasing the price so quickly is a deterrent stars at the price point but stars at the price point ,1
catches litter well for the first couple days then it must be vaccuumed but that is very easy to do ,1
i opened the box took out one of the bars and was surprised at how large the packaging was compared to the size of the actual snack it did not look appetizing at all and appeared to have been shoved in the wrapper haphazardly i tried a bite and was pleasantly surprised at the chewy texture and the flavor also not having dairy gluten or soy is a big plus the big drawback is that they are rather heavy and i could only eat about the bar no wonder they are so small i think that as a meal replacement the whole bar would be fine but as a snack they might be too much overall this was an okay product i would buy it again in the future but not on a regular basis i gave it four stars because it did have a nice flavor and works for just about any food allergy ,1
this brand is a little hard to find in stores as i do not think it is carried by any of the major supermarket chains i discovered it at au bon pain and noticed that unlike other brands i have tried this one is not from concentrate and has nothing added it is just pure unadultered coconut water so the quality can not get much better the other thing i really like about it is that it is a glass container rather than paper or plastic so the taste is not compromised these things alone are worth stars to me but there are a couple things i would suggest to make it even better first this is not really pulp the way you would think of it from you experience with fruit juices where there is pulverized very small drinkable pieces floating in the liquid these are chunks of diced coconut that you have to chew up while drinking to me this would be fine if they were all the soft flesh you would expect from a young cocunut but many of the pieces are harder which is unpleasant in a drink second ounces does not go a long way i would like to see it bumped up to at least a i would then feel like i am getting an adequate amount for my money and it would last longer and quench better ,1
my wife loves this stuff and it is hard to find thank god for amazon they found it for us ,1
these are the best gummi bears ever i love the variety of flavors watermelon and strawberry are my favorites definately will be buying over and over again ,1
my dog absolutely loves these treats we started sticking his meds into them at night because he sometimes gets uncooperative about taking them well now that he has had these he has gotten very picky and puts his nose in the air when we pull out his other treats that he gets during the day now we have created a dog snob truly i wod recommend them to anyone i will also tell u the price u find on amazon is currently the best price out there ,1
this is by far the most nutritional granola i have ever been able to find the flavor is ridiculously awesome highly recommend and will continue to buy mix with nonfat greek yogurt with extra cinnamon for an awesome treat ,1
the seller did a very good job with packaging only thing is that the producer company filled the big jar with a half of stevia powder in this size pound could fit but this is not the sellers fault they are honest and reliable shop nice to deal with ,1
after my brother a film animator formerly with the walt disney company made a tv commercial for season brand sardines i decided to try the product and have been a lover of the tiny brisling variety since then this is now more than years ago they are packed in various sauces and oils but my favorite is pure olive oil and lightly smoked wild caught from the cold waters off scotland i cannot imagine doing better than that most sardine lovers whether they eat them for health they contain over of omega fatty acids or just as a wonderful gourmet food love the tiny ones the taste is nut like and delicious i like them best in a sandwich of toasted seeded jewish rye with romaine lettuce there is nothing else needed ,1
very pleased with the product and the lightning delivery i have shopped thru amazon for years and i have never had a negative experience ,1
this is the best gum i have found since hersey discontinued their koolerz brand several years ago this stuff is also made by hersey both the spearmint and peppermint flavors have a nicely combined minty sweetness that lingers for quite a while the texture stays chewably soft for even longer another thing i really like about this gum unlink others i have tried is it does not stick to my fillings or crowns and i do not wind up with little pieces between my teeth the only problem is the investment to get your first sample if you can find it in a store it is not everywhere one of these packs costs over a dime a piece it can be less per piece here but multiple tubs designed to fit in a car cup holder is a bit if a gamble if you have never tried it it is great gum and you will probably like it if you like gum i was lucky and sat next to a guy in a plane who offered me some and if you should run into me ask for some because i will be having some on hand from now on please feel free to let amazon and me know whether this was helpful to you or not since it helps me improve my reviews ,1
it is not overally strong which is nice but i only taste the spices it does not taste like pumpkin at all ,0

this gingerbread house kit is a p of s while working on the first one with my daughter one of the roofs collapsed as we were gently putting candy on top of it had to run to the store and buy another one same thing happened re tried using unbroken parts from both houses to piece it back together and the whole thing just fell apart i followed directions meticulously waiting nearly minutes instead of the suggested for the frosting to solidify i did not put any more pressure on the thing than necessary but the thing still broke later i am stuck with a sloppy sticky mess in my kitchen no gingerbread house and a disappointed on my hands this product sucked ,0
i do not like the taste which perhaps can be expected i am not a big coffee drinker however my daughter who likes coffee did not like it either and says she would rather go without than drink it again my expectations were for a very chocolate raspberry flavored coffee drink what i got was a harsh coffee taste with a slight aroma of raspberry and maybe a hint of chocolate i did not taste the raspberry or chocolate at all ,0
i love the flavor of creme brulee so when i got my machine i also ordered a gazillion flavors including this amazon has a much better price than the cbtl website and quite a few flavors the butterscotch is decent too all these coffees pack a puch but the flavor is not lost in the strength add a little nestle pumpkin pie spice xreamer and a little sweetener and it makes a very tasty beverage ,1
i grew up munching on abuelita chocolate and was excited to see a hot chocolate mix in the grocery store however one packet was fairly watered down in taste compared to the tablets but i figured out that using about one and a half packets fixes the taste and makes a very delicious drink it gets thicker and starts to remind me of this ,1
i recieved the package and imediately opened it up to see what i needed to make them it surprised me when i discovered that alomost everything you needed was already included it was so easy to make and taste was spot on it is a great item for a party or just a snack ,1
purchasing these dog treats in this large package size saves me lots of money these are my two dogs favorite treat and i have purchase this size three times now my dogs love them ,1

i never expected this to be as great as it is i was concerned that my bean soup would taste like chili but it was delicious the whole family loved it and this is now a must have in my kitchen try this you will be glad you did ,1
already on my box of this stuff it is terribly addicting you do not even need sugar or cream if you are a pro coffee drinker otherwise a little cream but the coffee is actually already sweet i love this flavor very smooth soft not too bold and best of all you can actually get pots out of packet i dont know how they do it but they must use incredibly high quality coffee it is perfect hot or iced highly recommended p s also try butter pecan jamaican me crazy and almond amaretto ,1
did you ever travel to another area and not like the taste of the water a squirt of mio can be the solution mango and peach are of my favorite flavors and in my opinion mio captures them nicely my mother stopped drinking water because it tasted awful to her we all need to be hydrated especially our senior seniors especially the stubborn ones who insist on living alone now she does not have to make a heavy quart mix mio is convenient any glass size that is comfortable to hold she can make it the strength she likes lot is of us do not enjoy the carbonation of soda mio is perfect for us i am looking forward to trying other flavors ,1
very nice product my sister in law loved it would defintely buy other products from this company ,1
i read reviews of this product but was not quite ready for the taste it is hard to describe kind of like drinking something from a bottle in a storage shed that does not have a label on it the product works well ,1

you will eat this bacon and weep because you will realize what you have been missing all these years nueske is bacon tastes as different and as better as good tuna sushi does to the canned stuff butt expensive yes but worth every penny the hillcrest farm where nueske is is made is so hardcore that they consider the f d a guidelines for bacon too lax so they abide by their own standards makes a super great present for any gourmand gourmet epicure or carb free diet head nueske is also makes a pepper bacon and this one is much better make sure to follow their cooking instructions to the letter expect almost no shrinkage and you will be set keep an eye on the nueske is web site they sometimes have sales and discounts ,1
the can of starkist solid white albacore i opened looked more like chunk light tuna with random bits of fish and other dark fish parts that one does not normally associate with solid white albacore in all my other experiences of eating solid white albacore from other brands the can usually contains a solid piece of fish from one part of the fish not chunks and bits from who knows where do not get me wrong i eat chunk light tuna as well and it is fine for sandwiches and everything but that is not what i paid for at least with the can i opened it seems like they either made a mistake or were cutting corners very disappointed ,0
this product works exactly as it is advertised no more rinsing wire baskets the coffe is as good as the already filled k cups that you buy in the store it is nice to just throw the whole thing in the trash when done and not clog the sink could not be happier as it gives me unlimited choices for coffee and it saves money too amazon is great ,1
i have a very interesting type of cat he is a siberian sort of like a norwegian forest cat and rather rare we got him as a rescue from the dumpster cat rescue volunteers in our area my husband saw this cat in a cage and absolutely just had to adopt him and we already had a cat and were living temporarily in rooms so you can imagine it was some cat one characteristic of the siberian is that they molt or shed fur in great quantities twice a year it just comes off there is a downy undercoat that stays put and some guard hairs but the main coat thick and lustrous just flies off you should see the pile outside my office door at home he sits there insane so the cat gets hairballs how can he help it and he prefers to disgorge those hairballs on the best decorative rug we own of course not on the linoleum in the laundry room the wood in the entrance or the regular wall to wall carpeting either no right smack in the center of the best rug so something had to be done anyway he needs to get rid of the hairballs and merely arfing them up is not sufficient cats can get a lot more hair stuck in their gut so i got a tube of laxatone on the vet is recommendation while you can use vaseline the problem with vaseline or mineral oil is that the lubricating agent also pulls some nutrients out of the cat and that is not healthy for them laxatone is rather like thick gooey petroleum jelly but it is fortified with linoleic acid linolenic acid and peptonized iron to prevent some depletion of nutrients it is flavored in this case with malt it would seem some cats enjoy the taste of malt it is known some cats will lap up beer i think it may be that cats eat rodents and in eating the mouse they eat what the mouse ate including perhaps grains that have malted in the gut of the mouse so perhaps this is naturally a flavor cats are inclined to enjoy in any case my cat loves this he gets the recommended dosage for his larger size over three days then gets a maintenance dose once a week or so the result is a reduction in hairball expulsion and better elimination if you cat does not like malt flavor there is no pleasing some cats there is a tuna flavored variety my previous cat an equally hairy furball of a maine coon was persnickety about food and was not a snacker she would eat the malt laxatone to some extent then she would refuse it this cat eats practically anything so he is no trouble and he enjoys his medicine i enjoy the improved health of my kitty ,1
these are and will always be delicious they are hard to find and was pleased to find it on amazon at a great price best price found anywhere my kids love the chocolate but the vanilla were even a better deal and of course also delicious give it a try you will not regret it ,1

i love this curry powder mix it is good for a variety of meats i make lamb and chicken curry with it it tastes like the good curry you get in an authentic indian restaurant and it is easy to make the directions are on the back just add meat onions and plain yougert and you are all set i also add a can of pigeon peas but you can use any veg you want although that is not in the recipe on box you can adjust the spicy hot level by adding more or less of the curry powder try it if you are a curry lover and even if you are not with this curry powder you may become one ,1
we love these cookies we take them for snacks at my son is preschool and they love them because it is makes for a fun letters exercise they taste great and make me feel better about offering cookies after a meal since they are made with wheat flour a great choice for your little snacker ,1
i used the frs powder for several months and had to stop using it because it caused stomach problems i was using one or two packets per day less than the recommended amount and i even tried diluting it more than recommended to make it less strong concentrated but it still caused problems the problems went away when i stopped drinking it while i like the taste and the convenience of the powder packets it is not worth the gastric disturbance ,0
the plants arrived well packed and on time it was planted in a patio pot with drip line and starter miracle grow pellet within a few days the healthy leaves turned bkack and dropped off leaving the center pod to grow within a week the leaves there turned black and now have dropped off also looking like one sick plant i took lots of photos over these days finally i replanted it in the soil near another banana tree with a drip line i have done all i could do and it looks like a loser it has not been in direct sun and we have not had a day maybe they will exchange for another banana yuma az ,0

at some point during this candy is life it was stored inappropriately i bought these to sell for cents each as a fund raiser however they had melted so much that the candy leaked out of the wrappers and re solidified making it impossible to unwrap ca not say this would be a consistent issue but i will not try it again ,0
we first started buying izze drinks when my wife was pregnant and she was looking for alternatives to soda and coffee the izze products were among her favorites especially the black cherry flavor the pomegranate variety is tasty as well consisting of fruit juice and sparkling water they make for a refreshing drink although not a very large one just over ounces one thing to note is that these drinks have calories each so that is something to be aware of they are better than soda but are far from calorie free ,1
i wont even buy coffee at starbucks because seriously this is better i have had my senseo for years and have no desire to have any thing other than this one i love it so much that i have a new back up machine in a box just in case this one ever goes out i know that sounds weird but seriously i love this coffee ,1

i love go raw products i eat a great deal of raw food and i travel for work these are perfect because they are really tasty and i can keep them in my purse ,1
there is a lot of sugar but mostly healthy ingredient but best of all my three year old loves these healthy snacks they have the consistence of a date bar and since it is basically a date paste that makes sense they are not too sweet even though they have of sugar i think they are tasty especially with a cup of coffee and are way better for you than a donut at and cal a lot less fattening they are pretty good size for a fruit bar and filling i would buy them again and recommend them ,1
it is getting hard to find whole bean hazelnut cream coffee here in town as most of the stores have taken out the whole bean dispensers to make room for the keurig products ordered this product as a christmas gift and she says the coffee is great,1
my son hated it i tasted some and saw why it is tart and the barley gives it a weird smell and flavor yuck ,0
these are sooooo good it tastes just like you are eating a fried apple this package of apple chips went so fast in my house granny smith is the best flavor to get in my opinion potato what ,1
this is one of the finest seasoned salt blends i have ever enjoyed this citrus one is most excellent for seafood i think its great in moderation and i bet you will too on a striped bass filet or swordfish steak under the broiler pepper not included ,1
the product is excellent especially for cold mornings where you want something to stick to your ribs it is great to know it is gluten free so safe to eat for me and my daughter and buying the value pack saves money too ,1
this is such a good deal for boxes of special k significantly cheaper than i can buy it for in the stores great value and packaged well i am doing the special k diet and have set up the subscribe and save so it comes direct to my door every couple months which makes sticking with the diet so simple ,1
i often have stomach issues and migraines chewing on these not only helps my stomach it also helps my head they are sweet carmely gingery candies there is only one problem you have to continually use the product to keep the nausea at bay for those of you that are pregnant i would recomend the christalized ginger first but if they are too strong for you these are a great second choice as they are a bit milder ,1
love this rice so yummy no more waiting although you do have to pre soak for mins this beats the hour regular cooktime though ,1
i must be careful in the future i have been very pleased with all my other amazon orders this was way too costly for small amount you receive also the cookies were not real fresh no more orders of this cookie ,0

i was a little skeptical when i bought this product despite all the great reviews i have never found a meal shake that i have come close to actually liking a lot but this one i do great taste even when used with water better with almond milk ,1
first of all they stink imagine fish lying around in the sun for a couple of hours yeah they are that smelly but that as it turns out is why my dogs love them so much these treats are so special in fact that they are only given out when we want to get our girls into their crates like at bedtime or if we are going out or something they even know the bag all i have to do it get it out of the cabinet and they are running off into their crates waiting happily for their treats i had read the review from the person who wrote that a fishbone had been found in one what i do is bend break them down the middle before handing them out so i can feel if there is something sharp inside so the bottom line here is if my dogs love them then i love them ,1
arrived quickly in good shape packaging was not damaged the quality of the product was very good when i used it and was what i expected of it ,1
could not be happier with the price i have got it in my bulk freezer to keep it fresh and fill up a tupper ware full of tea once a month probably a half an once or once a month at most really good tea for the price ,1
taste like carmels except softer ingredients sugar corn syrup plant stanol estrs nonfat milk less than of caramel color soy lecithin salt natural and artificial flavors and yellow sodium mg per chew or serving g of plant stanol esters per chew per day recommended on package expiration was about months beyond the date i recieved so that was good ,1
i sent this as a gift to my son at his dorm it was a congratulations on your great grades thing he enjoyed the cake ,1
i really loved this water i have been ordering it since february it does not have that strong mineral taste most of all it does come from fiji is natural spring water and not tap water disguised as mineral water unfortunately i can not order it any more due to amazon switching from fedex shipping to fedex smartpost i live in an apartment complex and the post office will not deliver it to my door as fedex did i really feel let down by amazon but i will definitely look for another way to order it i like it that much ,0
this is quite possibly my very favorite iced tea ever it has a sweetness to it without being at all sweet it is so nice and mellow and delicious just be aware that in this package little packets of loose tea that make qts of iced tea each not large iced tea bags so you will need an iced tea maker to utilize them you probably already realized this i am fairly certain that i am just too blonde to have gotten that from the description but it is soooo good if you are wanting the iced tea bags get the smaller boxes of this you really can not go wrong either way ,1
i recently became gluten free and needed individual packets because i eat my oatmeal after i get to work the portions are a little larger than quaker is individual packets for instance and i am glad because it fills me up i love all the flavors and will continue to buy it just wish gluten free was not so darn expensive this was my first time ordering from amazon and was very pleased with the service ,1
the flavor of these cherries is excellent my favorite of the various ones i have tried with amazon they are plump and tart and you do not taste the apple juice this whole organic thing is a non issue they explain it on their web site the cherries are being transitioned to organic i recommend them highly and will buy more ,1
after years of watching my older miniature schnauzer cosmo suffer very bad itching especially along the back and starting to see the younger one get it too it was truly a blessing to find this product which pretty much brought an end to their itching i have almost forgotten the sound of the chair hitting the table as cosmo steps back and forth with his back under the chair is lower horizontal wood planks scratching all of his hair off and eventually his skin but i still have pictures of the bloody red patches thank you chicken soup for making a healthy natural product that does not give my dogs terrible skin reactions ,1
in our house i have been barred from ever buying hamburger helper i suppose that is what happens when you cook from scratch for a bunch of boys nightly so when i mentioned that we were going to try this the number of moans and groans almost outweighed the sound of the hamburger cooking in the skillet but were we ever in for a surprise this stuff is awesome it actually includes a large packet of smooth velveeta cheese to mix in with the entree and just that one element really makes it go over the top in taste mind you if you would like to save the calories from the cheese packet the entree tastes great without it my only complaints are it is a bit salty this is particularly heightened after adding that packet of cheese it is not over the top like some soups can be but it is definitely a negative if you are on a salt controlled diet this might be an issue the actual serving size of the package is small and i mean very small if you have a family of then each individual would get one serving any larger than that then you are in trouble unless you have very young children if you have a hungry husband and sons you will wind up buying boxes to actually make enough to fill them up my suggestion add a salad with meat along with a vegetable and some healthy bread and that helps considerably in addition add something like a can of diced tomatoes to this dish and use ground turkey or chicken to make it healthier milk to drink always helps too there is enough sauce to add an additional pound of meat to the dish along with the tomatoes and the cheese sauce can cook a bit longer in the pan to make it more runny to infuse with the additional ingredients so this is definitely a keeper in this house i about fell off my chair when i heard a yum but velveeta has been creating yums for years and i am not surprised that this dish is in keeping with their history highly recommend ,1
this is the stuff salads were made for so yummy i put lots of goodies in my salad chicken walnuts green onions tomatoes and on and on and then top it with this and it is a salad made in heaven the only down side to this vinaigrette is that it is pricey but oh sooo good and so worth it i eat a lot of salads and so i can not use it each time i make one but for those special salads and for company this is what comes out a perfect balance of sweet raspberries and balsamic vinegar it is a home run would be a perfect item for a gift basket as well ,1
these puffs are our go to trip food they are not too messy and they taste fresh and not too sweet they are also not bad for adults either when you need to nibble on something but do not want a huge calorie commitment ,1
this hot chocolate has been a favorite of my family is for at least years it has a smooth chocolate taste with a hint of cinnamon it is irresistible and great for gift giving ,1
i bought this for my fiance is grandparents they seemed to really enjoy the basket it is a good gift for someone who has everything ,1
great taste my family will not eat some brands of wheat products prefer the regular white noodles usually but this one passed the muster with them ,1
my rescue puppy loves this food and what a difference it has made in his coat and all around health just a well balanced food ,1
great in rice rice dishes good flavor kinda salty also good in the wok just be careful of the bonito flakes burning ,1
every morning like clock work right after their breakfast my two dogs have to have these they love them they argee with them very well ,1
while in a pet shop and new to cats the owner suggested i try this tuna dash product so i bought some one night the cat food was not what the cats wanted so to encourage their eating i added some of this product to their food just on top to get them started and they ate their food this was my way of discouraging finnicky eating it worked i would use it off and on as needed and most of the time i forgot i had it because it was not needed but oh when it was needed what a help when might it be needed after vaccinations for example when they were mad at me for that vet trip or once in a while one of them would go off feed probably from eating a mouse or something and i would let them fast a day and then reencourage them back to regular food with the help of tuna dash i like the product and glad i found it here as the pet store went out of business ,1
i am so distraught that this product is being taken off the market whenever i can gather the together to get another carton with all the boxes in it i do so as fast as possible i hate that this is going away i love the taste and it is so satisfying bekki shanklin,1
this is a great product helped me to give up table salt and adds so much flavor to all my recipes the only downfall is in the packaging the last orders sent were not wrapped properly by amazon and lost of two bottles in the box hoping that amazon has corrected that problem ,1
these sounded too good to be true and they were the taste of these is downright awful i have eaten a lot of protein bars and while these seem to have fewer chemicals and more wholesome ingredients than most they sure did not taste like it honestly these taste nothing like chocolate and really just taste like maltitol ,0
the treats were simply fantastic fur lulu have just about eaten them all up they need some more they have only one left down to using the powder thank you much ,1
the products are ok but my experience with the people who work at flying noodle is what truly turned me off i would rather deal with local people who are honest and who can not hide behind their online anonymity it is too bad because there are so many good internet companies out there if you want more details just ask me personally ,0
i totally thought i would be getting boxes for that price i did not it was box with small snack packs i found this product on another site for a single box for what a rip off ,0
the jury is still out on glucosamine chondroitin whether it helps or not even in people but it i do not think it can hurt and this is a delicious way to get it into your best friend if i am talking about them i have to actually spell chicken sticks because my dogs will make a beeline to where they are they love them a little too much this is the best price going anywhere i buy big bags at a time and even with the small shipping cost it is about a bag cheaper than the next lowest competitor ,1
i use habanero pepper in a lot of my dishes but boyyy this cayenne pepper is hot i am known for loving hot and spicy stuff i used it for the first time last night and i think i underestimated the hu i poured in close to of a cup did not measure the amount to what i was cooking and i can barely eat it without having to drink water and chew on crackers it was as hot as blazing wings from buffalo wild wings and this might be tmi but whenever i ate this dish i cooked and i did a i felt the tingling sensation as if the pepper in my mouth so my conclusion is i think a little goes a long way ,1
all three tastes rich and chocolaty not chalky at all we were surprised how good they are better than any other k cup cocoa we have tried ,1
well maybe it will not actually spice up your love life but then what can you say about powdered wasabi besides it got you reading this review we mix thoroughly two tablespoons of the powder with about a half cup of fat free mayonnaise use it as a table condiment good stuff ,1
i have been using this for years and every one i knows wants to know whats in it i tell them its my little secret best stuff ever ,1
this stuff sounded too good to be true but i tried it anyhow and wow am i glad that i did i usually eat as a snack spread on a chocolate vitatop muffin i mix tablespoon calories with just enough water to make a good spreadable consistency and then spread it on the muffin top so yummy i am not sure why there are or so one star reviews i guess if you are looking for the creaminess of peanut butter then you will not like this because it does not have any oil in it it is also more like natural peanut butter and not like jif or peter pan which have lots of added sugar the powder also tends to repel liquids so you have to treat it a bit like flour if you want to mix it into something else start by mixing a small amount of water with the powder until it loses the powdery texture then add the peanut powder water mixture to your recipe ,1
i ordered this discounted food knowing the discount would off set the shipping my cats love this cat food i have fed it to them for years and will keep buying it solid gold is an excellent brand never had any of the cat food recalls so i felt i made a wise decision even though the product listed did not include the size bag turns out the size was a lb bag still a savings with the discount i have also ordered through petfood direct never had a problem with their service or with their products the drawback was the bag was expired ordered and expired i am very disappointed i spent the money on expired food which i will not feed my pets there is a reason why a manufacturer puts an expiration date on their food so no i will not order this product again and i wonder if that was what the discount was all about getting rid of expired food the only way they could i will not order dry cat food on line again not through petfood direct not when their people do this to a customer ,0
these are a great snack lunch option that i can take with us anywhere i keep them on hand for my grandchildren and love that they are healthy convenient and taste good the kids really love them and actually ask for them especially the peanut butter and turkey stick packages we usually take them with us when we are traveling or going to the zoo or museums ,1
after our local italian espresso bean store burnt down we were hard pressed to find beans we liked let alone loved we saw kicking horse on amazon looked up other reviews online and decided to give them a try thank god the taste is great and the price is good unless our old place rebuilds we have found our favorite ,1
by far this is my favorite of the various unrefined salts i have tasted it is robust can a salt be robust and has a taste that is far more than mere nacl i use it whenever i need salt and even travel with it i get the pouches since it is a bigger bargain ,1
when i first opened this product i was expecting a lower quality cardboard replica of popcorn what i got instead was cracker jacks with fudge more than a drizzle but less than a coating these are scrumptious the oz calorie pack is just the right size for an afternoon snack without feeling overly indulgent a sweet aftertaste with no added chemical tang that you occasionally get with other products the only drawback that i encountered was that they made me extremely thirsty brown sugar is the first listed ingredient so maybe that is where the problem lies taste wise nabisco did a great job with this product without a doubt i will be purchasing these on my own price wise once again this product can be found cheaper elsewhere if you are looking for a limited guilt snack check them out but first check pricing and get your money is worth ,1
these packs of dumplings are a good size and make dumplings each pack i can not buy the mix in stores that good and that cheap absolutely delicious ,1
i have had all types of hot sauce but this one is hot spicy and still flavorful i have used up almost a bottle already this is a good buy ,1
i love the crackers but was very disappointed with the expiration date i bought boxes figuring they would last me for months unfortunately the expiration date on the boxes was july that is only months that is not reasonable ,1
i am gluten intolerant and this bar suits my needs perfectly it is not very sweet but it is satisfyingly sweet enough to taste really good and has a definite peanut butter flavor it is a perfect go to snack when i do not want toindulge in rich desserts but am just craving something tasty i often eat a bar in the movies and do not feel deprived knowing that other people are eating candy the peanut butter is my favorite flavor you need to be careful when buying these macrobars as some of these bars are made with gluten sweeteners like barley malt when i saw these bars for the first time displayed in a health food store in another state i had a difficult time distinguishing the gluten free bars from the regular ones i am not following a macrobiotic diet but i like knowing that this baris a very healthy gluten free option to eating a quick meal on the go it is not always easy to find totally gluten free meals away from home so i always keep a macrobar in my purse just in case i am feeling hungry ,1
when i first started my cats on wellness core i thought it was fabulous suddenly their fur was shiny and bright they liked it too but then reality set in a couple of bags later all of my cats were losing their fur in massively scary amounts i am not talking basic shedding either their fur was falling out everywhere this food was causing excessive hair loss all over their bodies on all my cats i was really worried because it was bad the rep at petco told me when i informed her of this problem that other customers had noticed the same problem in their cats i have read other reviews as well where people complained about a hairball problem with this food this was no ordinary hairball problem let me tell you in addition this food is absolutely not for cats with weight gain tendencies i reduced my lb male cat is daily intake to well under of this stuff plus a tbs of canned daily and he still gained weight on it my opinion is there is some vital problem with this food that would cause such hairloss either there is an ingredient in it that should not be there or there is something missing that should be there the wellness regular dry w grains caused flakes in my cats as well the wellness canned is the only thing i highly recommend from wellness ,0
very tasty coffee well worth the price comes with a container to put open coffee in i will definently buy this coffee again ,1
i do not much like sweet potatoes or things made with sweet potatoes but these are really very good they have an unusual taste that is hard to describe it is a little on the sweet side perhaps too sweet for some great for others popchips any variety are not quite as hard or crunchy as regular potato chips but that seems like a plus to me they have a nicer consistency than potato chips i have tried other varieties of popchips too and i like them all this one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat not sure of the exact process but the result is a wonderful chip that i prefer to regular chips i would not call these healthy but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips i would eat popchips all the time over other chips except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips the extra you pay for these is worth it if you like this style of chip i can not imagine anyone not liking popchips although perhaps not everyone would like this flavor give it a try and you will most likely be hooked ,1
easy to install and maintain works well with enough of a jolt to stop my dog but not enough to really hurt him ,1
this was a good deal to send to my college student especially with the discounted shipping with student prime she could not afford to buy red bull on her own so i thought i would send an unexpected treat and she was thrilled ,1

these crackers are the best i have tried so far if i did not have celiac is disease i would buy a non gluten free cracker but am very pleased with the consistency softer than others i have tasted of this gluten free cracker and it does not have that peppery taste that most others have they are great in soup or with peanut butter or cheese as a snack ,1

lots of cocoa for the money one of the cans was dented but i just kept that one for myself and used the other one for a gift ,1
the package of the product is appealing until it is ready to use there has been several methods used to open this product pulling the nozzle twisting the nozzle squeezing the bottle snipping the nozzle etc what is the point of a nozzle that can not be used only by opening the entire top can the syrup flow which produces a sticky residue and does not pour to well how can you open this ,0
this stuff is amazing seriously tastes great and way better than the sugary red bull or even sugar free because it contains an all natural sugar and non of that funky fake stuff after a night of drinking this really helps rejuvenate and give you some added energy as well its a clear liquid and not bright pink and has a light sweet taste but nothing over powering i can not find it anywhere as i believe it is a new product i am ordering multiple cans because its something you want on hand when you are feeling a little under the weather or just had too much to drink the night before and your forced to be productive the next day ,1

for those of you who says this cereal is dry and hard to chew or any similar comments and for those of you planning on buying this cereal you must remember that you have to soak the cereal in your liquid for at least minutes up to overnight whether that liquid is milk of any kind yogurt water whatever the rule for servings is a ratio of cereal to liquid other than the slight preparation time needed this cereal is surprisingly good for a healthy cereal a little more calories than your sugary kellogs or general mills cereal and takes a tiny bit of getting used to but those calories come in more good carbs and fats instead of nothing but bad carbs and sugar like other types of cereal i also like the fact that it is very versatile i have not tried the chocolate chip cookie recipe on the bags yet but i have heard that it is good and it would not hurt at all to add any kind of fruit of your liking to this cereal chopped apples blueberries cherries bananas etc and you can eat it hot like oatmeal or cold i would not buy this cereal however if you do not like sunflower seeds because as others have said there is a very noticeable amount of them in it i did not expect this cereal to be good at all so honestly i bought it planning on it to be horrible was going to bear it out anyways due to the fact that i am on a diet and want to have as a filling yet quick breakfast as possible without breaking my calorie consumption bank i do add about teaspoons of sugar or honey to mine but turns out that bob is red mill muesli is nothing that has to be borne do not get me wrong not close to as good taste wise compared to my oldtime favorites cinnamon toast crunch and captain crunch but if you are looking for a healthier cereal that gets you through to lunch time without hunger at less than calories including whole milk and the optional honey or sugar so it would be even less if you are using or fat free skim soy milk then this is definitely the cereal for you i am about to purchase an order of the larger bags myself on subscribe save those bags are more than twice the cereal at less than twice the price so it is a better value but if you are not sure if you will like this cereal then these bags will do as a trial order as that is what i did also i would like to add that the one serving size on the bag of of a cup of cereal is ridiculous my calorie counts in this review includes technically servings at a cup of cereal to one cup of liquid for each meal of eating this cereal ,1

these taste very good but are not like the best things ever either in order of my preference gross to good with explanation the rainforest flavor one is my least favorites i do not recommend this particular flavor has a weird cayenne pepper aftertaste to it do not get me wrong i love cayenne but not in a cookie the tropical one tastes as if corn bread was turned into a cookie version not a bad taste really good actually the original is very great i forgot the taste though but i remember liking it alpine in my opinion is the best it tastes like a european type of christmas cookie it has a chocolaty carob taste to it but not overly sweet ,1

this item was a part of an order that had two other items each from different sender i received the first two within a few days this one never showed up when it was already a few days late i had an order number so i checked where it was to see why i have not still gotten it it was delivered to san diego california i live in slc utah ok just a mistake no problem i emailed the company and they gave the shipping number to check where it is because they sent it first of all they gave me a wrong number luckily i had mine saved from when i made the order when i copy pasted the delivery to sand diego info and asked them what is up with that i never got the reply back i tried again a few days later asking do they intend to resend this item or will they give me a refung still no replay this is not a lot of money but it pisses me of that i ordered something through amazon and the company is doing this i will most definitely never order anything from them again and today i am contacting amazon to see what they can do about it it is not the money it is the principal ,0
overall a nice tea that i think would satisfy most daily tea drinkers my only complaint is that it is just not strong enough for me but in all honesty i like a very strong cup of tea so i think it would satisfy almost everyone else ,1
please make sure to buy a small box first make sure you like it befor buying it i think it is terrible ,0
i am an avid fan of indian chai i have even tried to make it authentically heating up the milk combining spices into cheesecloth and adding to the boiling milk very good homemade but a lot of work especially weekday mornings under a time crunch so i resorted to trying indian chai loose leaf and bags read somewhere that the term chai actually refers to a type of prepared tea so chai tea is redundant must have tried or either too weak too peppery or too sweet celestial seasonings india spice chai tea is the closest i have experienced to authentic chai flavor is full bodied without being overwhelming or acidic spicy without being pungent more spicy than sweet you can distinctly smell the spices cinnamon ginger cloves cardamom nutmeg black pepper chinese star anise and vanilla bean in the tea bags a wonderful aroma in the kitchen after it is brewed too since i prefer a bit more caffeine and body in my tea i double bag and brew the english breakfast tea cs india spice chai tea oz oz milkmicrowave for minutes continue steeping to desired strength chai recipes suggest adding honey optional but like other reviewers i find the spice blend does not need added sweetness happy to see cs india spice chai tea on amazon since local supermarkets seem to have stopped carrying it in favor of flavored green tea great deal too ,1
i have used this yeast for years but it recently disappeared from the stores i am not sure why fleischmann is is discontinuing this product in favor of versions with additives glad to have a supply for now ,1

nutiva organic coconut oil is the finest coconut oil available it is taste texture and purity is addictively delicious i use it to make salad dressings sautee with it put it in smoothies drizzle it on yogurt creating a creme brulee like crust and use it as a spread on english muffins try adding raw honey on top of it for a taste sensation when you discover the health benefits of coconut oil you will understand why this product is one of the greatest gifts you can give to your family when you feed them ,1

i use this product for countless things always have it on hand and find more uses for it all the time when looking for a better deal than the local stores i came here while the box case price is excellent the shipping expense that exceeds the product price itself by almost is ridiculous wo not be buying it here that is for sure all in all the product itself is wonderful i highly recommend it if you can find a better deal somewhere or do not mind paying such frightening shipping costs i could purchase another entire case of boxes and donate them to the local shelter soup kitchen for what i am asked to pay for just the shipping here too bad would have liked to make purchase on regular basis so i could have donated some ,1
the rainforest is a little weak as espresso go but if your doing latte type drinks it is pretty much perfect fantastic flavor if you are drinking espresso as espresso by itself you might want to look for a stronger coffee ,1

i was very keen to have my new cats take to this thing what a disappointment when one kitty tried to claw it the thing promptly fell over and now she will not go near the thing neither cat has given it even a little scratch yes it is cheap but now it is worthless ,0
we grilled deermeat with this marinade at a tailgating party at a reasent football game and everyone loved it i injected it andit was the best thing we grilled allday everyone there asks about the marinade its good but hard to find in the stores,1
it was cute seeing all of these candies together in one package but most of it can easily be bought at local mass market stores also many of the candies were simply stale and inedible not really worth the money unless you have money to throw away ,0
this bread is really good and it is double wrapped for freshness our family likes it toasted with a thin layer of butter on it and the cinnamon swirls are easy to spot and the plump raisins are abundant it is great for breakfast or a snack to tide you over for dinner ,1
this is a great price for this product we love sunbutter we do not like other similar products but this one tastes and smells just like peanut butter we have been buying this for the last few years and not a day goes by where someone in my family is not eating it it is high in protein does not need refrigeration great for on the go and tastes great ,1
these are great bars and i became used to having one each morning the taste is addictive and if you are a chocolate or snickers lover you are really going to like them nothing like eating a healthy candy bar for breakfast and now i have to hide them from my third grader unfortunately my local wal mart quit carrying them as did everyone else and amazon is the only place i have been able to find them luckily the price here is cheaper than they were with wal mart ,1
first lets talk about the fish i eat a lot of sardines and i was just giving these a try the fish does not taste very good i can tolerate a high fish taste but the ones in the roland cans taste pretty bad fishy now lets talk about the sauce the description says sardines in tomato sauce with chili to give you a heads up there was no chili not even a little hint of it in the sauce it was bland tomato sauce and lacked any seasoning i expected a bit of a kick from the sauce but i was disappointed its better to go with the ligo brand if you want to at least taste a bit of the chili so now i have a lot of sardines that i dont like ,0
i missed having poi with hawaiian dinners now that i am living on the mainland and thought i would give the powered poi a try i was truly amazed that it was so very much perfect easy to prepare for or finger thickness and i will definitely purchase it again please keep making this product ,1
just right to heat up for chili dogs or to make queso dip love the fact i do not have to pick out the beans as i did with other chili find it even mixes well into a pot of mac n cheese reorder when running low ,1

my dog has major skin allergies and was chewing and pulling her hair out i tried every food that said it was for skin problems or allergies nothing did any good then i saw this and decided to give it a try after weeks her hair is growing back in she is not chewing or scratching all the time it is expensive but this is what she will be eating from now on ,1
these little suckers were handed out as favors and they were enjoyed to the fullest everyone was wearing them and taking photos they are lots of fun and taste like grape thankfully because i thought it would be black licorice gag they have a little wax tab you can bite to hold the mustache in place they are totally edible i do not think you would want to swallow the wax ball that chewing them creates but they taste pretty yummy highly recommend these bad boys ,1
after months of near perfect behavior my golden retriever apparently discovered the puppy within herself and started destroying nearly everything toys that we have had for her entire life were suddenly being destroyed and stuff strewed across the house as if it were a warning to all other toys she was destroying and swallowing inch pieces of rope curtain ties everything so it is with desperation that i went to my local pet store in an attempt to find anything destructible from previous experience i knew she did not like kongs and i could not bring myself to purchase anything that was merely a used tire marked to up a pet toy price with that i found this toy and another indestructible chew toy while the other toy is good nothing holds her interest like this product it has drastically improved her behavior while crated and all other toys have been spared a painful death the only downside is that the product does not smell the best as she is always playing with it that means it is always near us we have tried instituting a no toys on the couch policy but its hard to enforce ,1
my cats loved these treats and i think that they really help with releasing the hairballs i noticed some changes in their litterbox which prove to me that these treats help with hairballs issues i am going to buy again from these treats before my cats finish them out ,1
this is a nice black tea with a mild smokey taste like all of adagio is tea it is deliciously fresh and of the highest quality great for the first pot of the day ,1
as a bachelor who frequently must grab a cup of joe at home and run i was reluctant to waste coffee in my braun drip machine and disinclined to clean up after the french press method a new york times article convinced me that a pod system would be the way to go and i found the philips senseo machine to be the best at the consumer level alas the douwe egberts pods that come with are um imho not good a brief web search led me to aloha island is senseo style pods and i ordered a box of their single serving espresso pods the package arrived swiftly and the box of pods was swaddled in styro peanuts nice touch i immediately placed a pair in the senseo unit and let it do its thing wow the quality of the coffee is to date unparalled rich smooth and frothy almost like a latte before the milk is added and i was surprised that the yield was about one ounce greater than with the de pods i am a believer an advocate and a confirmed drinker and fan thanks and mahalo ,1
this paste made preparation a breeze and it is absolutely delicious i am a big fan of indian food but have always been intimidated by complex gazillion ingredient recipes this is a wonderful way to make it at home in a flash even my husband pretty picky eater really liked it i will definitely be buying more ,1

this is the best brown rice i have ever tasted it takes a while to cook but the wait is well worth it ,1
ordered this to try some old school cocktails that called for it not realizing that orgeat is widely available as coffee shop syrup shots this would have perhaps been a better and cheaper because of the shipping costs choice it is usable at best ,0
perfect sized refill for our little gumball machine good color and flavor as well not so many that we can not use them before they get stale ,1
this is the worlds best italian dressing i use it for salads marinate fresh vegetables in it and marinate sliced roast in it wich tenderizes the meat and makes it taste like a juicy steak i love it but it is hard to find so glad to find it while shopping on amazon ,1
these muffins are easy to make and are delicious for some reason stores do not seem to carry them anymore will ask store manager where i shop to carry this product in the future ,1
the baby breeza worked great for a couple of months the machine started leaking grease from the driveshaft into the food it made my stomach turn to think i had been giving my son food with grease i bought this machine b c i did not want to give my son baby food from a jar and so that i know what he is eating i was very disappointed i also searched to see if other people have had the same problem and i was not the only one i ended up buying a ninja blender and a stovetop steamer ,0
if you go to a health food store you will always find bars like this near the checkout counter they are high end chocolate bars that use all organic ingredients and fair trade cocoa they all taste pretty good and sometimes they go on sale so you do not have to pay an arm and a leg for them newman is own tastes very similar to any number of high end organic chocolate bars they have about percent more calories than you would get with a hershey is but they also taste better i wish the squares for breaking off pieces were smaller because this is really nibbling chocolate not something you would eat a whole bar of in a single sitting i would not say these are special or extraordinary chocolate bars they are perfect decent though and if i had a hankering for chocolate and they were on special i would buy one at a checkout counter ,1
after realizing that i cannot find sulfite free coconut milk at a local store reliably i decided to try subscribe and save this is by far the best tasting and best consistency coconut milk i have tried i have used roland thai kitchen chaokoh golden star goya while the golden star and thai kitchen are good golden star does not even have guar gum native forest has the thickest creamiest layer of solids i have found which is perfect for making whipped coconut cream for my coffee dessert toppings and the added bonus of using bpa free cans unless i get a bad batch from sri lanka almost of the negative reviews are from that source i will forever be a native forest user ,1
like the writers of many other reviews i read i got a disproportionately high amount of plain special k around of my bowls i got no bowls of the kashi cereal the net weight of a bowl of plain special k is oz whereas the other cereals weigh in at around oz special k is also the cheapest cereal to make of the four making it extremely suspicious that many shipments of this assortment seem to be unbalanced in its favor i am pretty upset that i purchased a assortment that ended up containing only and an undesirable mix of those be warned based on the reviews here you are likely to have a similar experience ,0
this mustard makes all things you eat it on taste better i love all the flavors this brand supplies i very much wish that amazon could offer a variety pack i suspect that sales would be greater than anticipated i love this product i would give the entire operation five stars for a variety pack skeez,1
for me they are the best chocolate i have ever eat a little bit chocolate and peppermint i love it ,1
my kitties that is when i bring out the catnip all i have to do is make one tiny sound of my roll down desk board and they come running from anywhere how they hear one crack of that unroll and know it is catnip time i do not know but fun fun fun is about to begin roll rub twist and again roll rub twist relax push each other off the double scratching pad where i sprinkle the catnip two kitties vie for their dose of catnip om or wherever they go munch munch then roll again i am such their goddess for bringing on such delight what little to make so much happiness crazy kitty catnip ahhhhhh ,1

purchased baronet is coffee izzy is blend coffee pods for bunn my cafe which works perfectly this blend had absolutely no flavor no aroma and was watery i tried first with oz of water then the second cup oz of water it just has no flavor and i wasted my money ,0
these are a great first finger food snack they were much easier for my child to dissolve in her mouth than the gerber brand not sure if it is that because there is a whole in the middle so there is not as much solid mass in her mouth but she loved them immediately and had no gagging problem like she did with the other brands and you get more in the package as well we have only tried the greens and the apple but we have liked them and i like that they are organic ,1
a great alternative to regular peanut butter a little sweet taste the stats are great if you love peanut butter like we do try it ,1
i originally bought this for my year old who is very picky about textures in her food drinks and will go days without eating anything but milk when i found this i thought it would be great because she loves chocolate milk and this is highly nutritious so i ordered it when i made a cup of this with milk it seemed like it needed more chocolate flavor so i added ovaltine and it was delicious so i hid it in a sippy cup so she would not see the tiny green particles floating on top and i did not tell her anything was different about it but as soon as she started drinking it she started gagging and cried i do not like this seedy chocolate milk not wanting to waste it my husband and i have been drinking it we have both noticed that when we drink it we feel really good all day so if your child does not have a problem with textures then i think this product would be great for you ,1
fantastic product just as stated not disappointing will order again very happy with this product is good tasting nice that its organic ,1
these are definitely wasabi but they are pretty mild most wasabi flavored foods give a harsh burning sensation in my nose and mouth for a few moments some are hot enough to water the eyes and force me to contemplate the sadist that first marketed them as a food product instead of as a medieval torture device but not these the spice in these only hit the tongue whether that is a good thing or a bad thing depends on your own masochistic streak enjoy ,1
there are so many reasons to love raw cacao i cannot name them all what i can say is that i cannot get enough i make an energy smoothy every morning with this stuff and i feel great afterward it tastes great and it is great for you ,1
okay i am not a hot coffee person but iced coffee i am the biggest snob there is illy is the big company that makes most of the restaurant coffee products that you see in good quality italian restaurants and this is clearly one of their products the drink has a silky texture in the mouth and that right coffee punch without bitterness or wouldregs if you like iced coffee give this a shot the can is small but wow is it good ,1
after searching for finish glass magic in our local stores and on the internet shelves are empty of glass magic and have a small canister of finish booster which does not provide more bang for your buck i decided to try citric acid and a teaspoon added to dishwasher soap i use powder does a great job of producing sparkling clean spot free dishes and glasses the added bonus is that citric acid can be used for other household cleaning projects and in baking and cooking as an added note i have noticed that in some stores genuine tsp is also hard to find which could be used sparingly in a load of dishes phosphate is the magic word and why our cleaning agents no longer clean as they used to if you see pf next to a brand name on the package it means phosphate free and why our clothes and dishes do not seem as clean before phosphate was eliminated ,1
delicious salt does not dissolve too quickly so must be used with care ,1

these are one of the best tasting decaf k cups out there and the price is pretty good ,1
nothing wrong with the sugar besides the fact it is so expensive and does not last very long but after fun and time taking experimentation i have found a perfect and cheaper substitute it is called turbinado sugar and i found some at the whole foods in st louis but i would imagine they sell it at all whole foods they sell it in bulk and it is per pound so in comparison to what you buy in the store or find on amazon after shipping pound of teavana tea costs for the same you can buy pounds of turbinado sugar and you use it in the same ratio that you use the german rock sugar so you get times the bang for your buck,0
this blend of early grey is very mild as long as you do not over brew it it has a very subtle taste and a great blend for those who enjoy white teas however if it is left to brew too long the flavor can get a little bitter so just watch how long the tea bag sits in the cup and you will be sure to enjoy your cup of tea a great white tea that i recommend ,1

bought for the wife is birthday she is a nut and she loved it did not share much with me making another order ,1
really raw honey is the best honey i have ever tasted it is produced by one of the last apiaries left in the united states using organic beekeeping methods really raw honey is not labelled as an organic product so i contacted the company through their website and they told me that they do not use pesticides miticides or antibiotics on their bees and they do not feed the bees corn syrup or sugar and do not truck their bees all over the country to pollinate crops the jar is pretty large but it is more economical than the jar and it taste so good i will probably go through the lb jar in a couple of might see like a lot for of honey but you get what you pay for really raw honey is a high quality ethical product do yourself a favor and try it ,1

i have been taking flaxseeds for several years due to the health benefits i was excited to see such a great price on these from a reputable company these are the best tasting flaxseeds i have ever had to get the maximum health benefits you have to finely grind them in a standard coffee grinder we usually grind tablespoons per person twice a day and then add them to lemonade crystal light or tea and drink it down quick before it expands flaxseeds are loaded with minerals vitamins amino acids and fiber they are excellent for weight loss and work well for chronic constipation there are several web sites out there that can tout the health benefits of flaxseeds but unfortunately it is against the review guidelines to post links so i will just suggest to those of you wanting more information to search google ,1

i make hummus often and love it but always felt mine was never as good as the restaurant i was always looking for that missing ingredient i have tried other tahinis and they would leave a bad aftertaste this tahini along with fresh lemon juice and a great lebanese recipe has made the best hummus ever the first batch i made with this tahini was amazing as good as the restaurant it is different than others i have purchased thinner easier to mix and has a better overall smell i would recommend this to anyone who loves hummus ,1
cafe molido santo domingo coffee i bought bags bag would have been enough the coffee is too finely ground and very bland i have been to santo domingo and purchased coffee there in the grocery store that coffee was very rich and had a great flavor what happened to this coffee in transition is anyone guess i drink a lot of coffee this coffee is no comparison to a good columbian blend ,0
we all love this cereal and with people in our family it was getting expensive to keep going back to the store to get more love that i can get boxes at once and save money it tastesgreat and the raisins are not hard like other cereals like it ,1
i have ordered salmon jerky from snackmasters before and really liked their product but it was a couple years ago i recently ordered a package from them again the jerky was so hard it was like chewing leather i do not mind my jerky on the harder side but my jaw hurt after a couple pieces i also found fish bones in my jerky which i think is unacceptable especially for the cost of the product ,0

i have been a herbal tea drinker for many years and when i try a new brand i expect to be disappointed numi is moroccan mint tea is fresh tasting with full bodied flavor and a clean finish i love that the tea bags are fully organic not just organic tea in a synthetic bag what i also love is that if you are brewing your mug of tea and the phone rings or you are distracted by something when you come back the taste of the tea is just as fresh and delicious i can not wait to brew this for iced tea next summer i just had surgery and was queasy afterwards and numi moroccan mint tea was the only thing that tasted good and it also settled my stomach recently i left a box on the counter when i went on vacation and when i returned my sister who was sitting my dog asked where can we get more moroccan mint tea another convert whether you buy it here or in a local store taste the difference i certainly did i will now try some of the other herbal teasans ,1
love spicy spicy spicy hot sauce want something that is more portable than a glass bottle and easier to distribute evenly on food than a liquid here is your answer this is probably my perception as spicy as the blair is liquid version i usually tend to eat hot sauce on solid foods eggs rice etc rather than liquid foods soups chilis etc so a powdered form is probably more useful for me than the liquid which tends to bunch up in one bite and then your mouth hurts also this is really really spicy really much more spicy than tabasco or any other commercial sauce you might get so if tabasco is not spicy for you this is probably up your alley if tabasco is a spicy sauce not a flavoring agent b c it is actually quite tasty in it is own right just not super spicy to your taste this will probably overpower your taste buds use sparingly and build up the amount you use over time what is spicy in is usually spicy out if you know what i mean so if you are not used to it you will be sorry ,1
our dog eats their dry food but won t eat their wet food i wish i could return the cans ,0
i was very disappointed in this product the ingredients say that it contains either cornstarch or tapioca starch the one i got used tapioca and that might have made the difference the powdered sugar was like plaster as another reviewer stated it was very lumpy and my frosting never got the silky texture i have gotten for years with the cheap o powdered sugars i bought in the supermarket ,0

i first tasted lady grey tea in a twinings sampler box and after cup of this tea i went back to the store to buy a box of it it is got a lovely pleasing taste it has more prominent citrus notes than earl grey but is overall less intense in flavor and does not get bitter as quickly i like to have a variety of tea flavors around since i tend to drink two to four cups of tea per day at work and like to switch things up a bit but this is the one tea that fits every mood and helps to melt some of my stress away when in doubt i go with lady grey and i am never disappointed i have shared lady grey with some of my fellow tea drinkers at work and it has been a universal hit ,1

i used to buy this sugar for years i do not eat much sugar but still this sugar is called turbinado sugar but is misleading i picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar and other brands in the local food store that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something how did i find out i needed just a sweet water few days ago i put this sugar in the raw in the glass the water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just pure white sugar crystals what a shame on the producer u can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well how do they color it who knows ,0

i bought these cakes at my local health food store they look nothing like the images on the box in which they come they have no trace of cocoa they have nothing of the lightness of actual pound cake they are heavy and too sweet they taste like a chunk of fat and sugar which is what they are the second ingredient after eggs is sugar and then vegetable shortening that especially the latter item should say it all ,0
while the price is not ideal and there is only about or bunnies in a pouch there is no comparison in taste to other gummy fruit snacks we are trying to stay away from red dye so these were a good alternative come down in price and i will make these a staple in my pantry my kid loves them ,1
i was extremely dissapointed in this product i purchased it because it did not hfc listed on the label hfc is not something that i can digest and therefore since this item can not be returned it is no use to me nor would i foster it on someone else ,0
there is very little meat in this food and there are toxic chemicals various meat by products lower quality than whole meat or meals and harder to digest than actual meat caramel coloring is only necessary when there is not enough meat caramel color may be carcinogenic liquid top sirloin flavor grilled chicken flavor flavoring is only necessary when the product has insufficient meat top sirloin flavoring is made from manure of cattle carageenan causes cancer including breast cancer read an interview with joanne tobacman md professor of internal medicine university of iowa at there are no vegetables in this food cesar has repeatedly stated that his entire goal in coming to the united states was to go to hollywood and be famous i think that that focus on fame and money is apparent in his approach to dog food give crummy food nice packaging and an appealing name that one is dog will eat it is no advertisement first the only thing one really has to do to sell dog food is make it so the dogs will eat it that the dog will eat it is no measure of the quality or benefit of the food dogs eat anything including manure which is part of this food as the meat flavoring ,0
i feel like i have tried every hot cocoa there is in the k cups while i do think this is the best hot cocoa so far it still is not great i am not sure what it is but all of the cocoa k cups seem to have a weird taste to them it is almost like there is artificial sweetener in them but i know there is not i set it on the smallest cup setting for cocoa this has more body to it than others i am still waiting and hoping that dunkin donuts will put out their hot cocoa in a k cup there really is nothing better than that if you want a k cup hot cocoa i would def recommend this over all the others ,1
i have been eating knorr lipton noodles for about years now they are simple to make inexpensive and tasty this particular variety is rather lacking in the flavor department as far as all the knorr varieties go this is near the bottom of my list i will probably not be buying this one again this flavor along with the other two new flavors bacon cheddar and scampi are rather disappointing i would have expected more from knorr the discontinued beef lo mein asian side from knorr was much much better than this ,0
i first had this at a fancy schmancy restaurant in san francisco it was an excellent conclusion to a lovely lunch the flavor manages to be slightly sweet and citrusy like baby aspirin it is lovely iced with cut up lemons and oranges in it i often give it as gifts to tea lovers it is the tea most of my tea drinking friends request when visiting our home we have reordered several times unless you are buying in bulk directly from the manufacturer amazon has the best price it runs about at the natural food store our local big chain grocery stores do not carry it ,1
nabisco keebler both make calorie cookie products but where nabisco is is tasteless mini chips keebler is are real cookies only smaller they look and taste like real cookies why nabisco can not take note and follow suit is beyond my comprehension thus where keebler is taste great nabisco is taste like sweet sawdust ,1

i find the best way to rate hot sauces on heat is to compare them to other sauces this is just slightly hotter than dave is insanity sauce but slightly less heat than mad dog inferno it is way hotter than any tobaso product if tobaso is the only hot sauce you have eaten i would suggest eating something more mild than blair is sudden death will give a good burn to just about anyone but the most serious chili heads what i like about this sauce the most is the flavor it is very good unlike some of the extract sauces which lack flavor i found this one to taste very good and it has the heat kick that many of the better tasting sauces do not have ,1
we have enjoyed several of the baronet varieties very good senseo coffee the decaf is full flavored ,1

this oatmeal is the best i have been eating quaker maple brown sugar since i was a kid and and this blows quaker away if you order mcdougall is through subscribe and save the price is exactly the same as acme store brand maple and brown sugar the consistency is different than quaker probably the biggest difference i noticed is with quaker i have always noticed a grainy type texture with every spoonful guess i just got used to that over the years with mcdougall is all you can taste is the real oatmeal flavor with a nice touch of maple and brown sugar subscribe and save has made going organic much easier on my pocketbook too there is no dollar amount on the fact that it gets delivered to my front door saving me precious time and gas from going all the way to the nearest whole foods for a healthier chioce in eating it is delicious cheap and so good for you thanks amazon for your subscribe and save program ,1

as one of my foodie friends would say this is numb yummie the first can was a gift from my mother we were so thrilled that i have purchased several cans since the best way is just very simply over pasta which makes it the perfect go to dinner when you come home tired and late and do not want to cook i have tried to use it with other ingrediants but it is never so good as when it is plain with just a pinch of extra good grated cheese ,1

the mix of berries is not for everyone as reflected in the other review but i really like it i first discovered this mix last year when i did the clean program and was looking for decent snacks that would not torpedo the program or bore my palate this stuff is awesome i am really psyched too that i can now get it through amazon rather than having to rely on the whims of my local whole foods ordering staff ,1
the product was delivered on time just as i ordered and reasonably priced what more can you ask for thanks ,1
flicks used to be my favorite candy until they were discontinued by ghiradelli way back when i am so glad they are back they are like bigger hershey kisses but the chocolate is better the cardboard tube assuming they still come in them also smells great after the candy is gone a childhood favorite ,1
while i liked everything about the fruit strip nutritional value all fruit no sugar added texture etc the taste did not match the product is description the ripened raspberry tasted more like apple and pear which are the first two ingredients the raspberry flavor was nearly non existant ,0
seattle is best is a great tasting coffee this flavoured one projectsthe vanilla taste either breakfast blend henry is or vanilla are excellent choices ,1
i went to a viatnamese restaurant for dinner one day and they had this sauce on every table thought of giving it a try and it was absolutely mind blowing had to get this for my home right then if you like asian hot sauces you have to try this has a solid heat element to it with good taste of chillies and garlic definitely recommended ,1
this seasoning is the best it has been changed to a different brand tone but i am buying up what iu can find under the durkee brand great on chicken beef venison in chili spagetti etc ,1
i like bold coffe and historically have really enjoyed kona coffee or blend but this is bitter harsh and tastes like tree bark less expensive k cups are bold and smooth for example i like tully french roast the italian roast is about as bitter as the kona i am pleased i only puchased two boxes of this stuff ,0
i love hot peppers hot sauces and ground chili peppers i grow peppers roast them and grind them myself but i also like to collect and use a wide variety of store bought products such as this one since chef prudhomme was one of the first if not the first to bring cajun food into the mainstream fine dining scene i felt confident in trying this ground chili assortment that bears his name over all i like it and would recommend it to someone who is interested in spicier food one thing to bear in mind it that spicy does not necessarily mean hot most of the chilies here are mild to medium as a matter of fact each jar has a heat level rating for each pepper they break down like this anaheim california beauty heat level new mexico perfecto heat level guajillo heat level ancho heat level pasilla heat level chipotle heat level arbol heat level i think that both the chipotle and the arbol are milder than listed but that is just an opinion each bottle contains ounces which is a fair amount for most people bear in mind that ground chilies are best when consumed within months after purchase i have known people that keep the same jar of ground chili in their pantries for years but they will be far from their best replacement bottles are sold separately but to be honest i just buy my ground chilies in bulk and then refill these bottles with that again a real nice starter set ,1
although i have quite a sweet tooth and love gourmet chocolates the,1
i was introduced to pemmican bars at philmont scout ranch specifically the cocoa karob i ate pretty well when the kids i was with turned up their noses at these bits of real food the cocoa karob specifically was just too far removed from the candy they wanted in a bar this was food these things rock it is really a food bar though they get lumped with energy bars a lot they have a ton of complex carbs good fats fruits fibers food etc lumped into a hunk that you can easly find room for in a backpack then provided you have enough water to get some portion of it down you are good to go the flavor is not very exciting and the bars are very dense the fruit and nut is fairly sweet but not what i would call a fruit bar i prefer the cocoa karob which is less sweet and seems to have less of the malty flavors going on in the fruit and nut i have taken these for ultra trail runs that had no aid stations they are a must on backpacking trips i grab them when i need food during the day but am not going to get a full meal in i can eat these fairly regularly without getting too tired of them and unlike all the other bars out there when i eat a pemmican bar i feel like i have eaten something i feel full and ready to move on ,1
amazingly delicious and convenient i love the bean salad right out of the can or added to rice eggs pasta anything even my carnivore husband likes it i keep several cans in the pantry so i always have something fast tasty and nutritious ready to eat as a snack or meal it is also a great gift ,1
i would have to agree with the other rating there is a sweet smell and taste i cannot pinpoint and truly do not care for it maybe its the lemon grass not sure but cannot tolerate it at all ,0
ok look these are the best most addictive snack foods that i have ever had the joy of tasting in fact i logged in to order my second five pounds and i will order another one after that seemed odd when it arrived in that little postal service box but oh the joy buy them ,1
i regularly heat soup in a microwave at my office brands include campbell is progresso etc in microwavable containers like this hc product each requires a slightly different time to heat completely so the first time i heat a product i watch it carefully to determine that time i followed the hc directions removing the metal lid under the plastic cover and replacing the plastic cover our microwave is a relatively low wattage model compared to the watts assumed by hc on the label so i knew it would take longer than the minute seconds they recommend because it was lunch hour other people were waiting while the soup heated we were all startled when there was a loud bang from the microwave and the plastic cover blew off the top and the container jumped splattering soup all over the inside of the oven it took about five minutes and a lot of paper towels and water to clean up the mess the soup that remained tasted fine and the meat was more tender than normal for soup in microwavable containers that said i cannot recommend it nor will i buy it again i choose such soups for convenience not excitement i did report my experience to conagra parent company of hc but to date they have not responded ,0
i do not buy anything for my dogs that has propylene glycol in it there are so manyother treats on the market with healthy ingredients ,0
these are a great find a dash of saltiness and a ton of flavor a nice crunch these are also a favorite of our year old daughter is makes a nice healthy gift for friends and family mmmm ,1
this is my favorite bedtime tea i used to use sleepytime then sleepytime extra but this product is better tasting and more effective for making me drowsy the ingredients also appear to be higher quality it has a pleasant flavor similar to chamomile but with other herbs added ,1
to get my cat to eat a cet chew i would have to cut it in half and unwrap it petrodex chews are the right size and my cat does not make me unwrap them ,1
these were very good on salads and by the handfuls i would recommend you trying these first then if you want to try the more bland plain ones i tried them both and like the spicy ones the best they are nor real spice just enough to give it some umph ,1
absolutely love the flavors in this tea my husband will not drink anything else ,1
not too sweet very european cookie good price no complaint at all if you enjoy cookies that are not too sweet crispy and light this is your cookie arrived in great condition no breakage ,1
hansens products are my new favorite beverage their juices are divine and the crisp clean quality can not be beat i have given up on grocery store juice hansen is is it for,1
this is a preliminary review we only switched from an all dry purina diet to a half wet half dry evo regimen a couple of weeks ago this food is not as expensive as it looks at first glance feeding instructions printed on the bags dictate that the daily serving of this food is half as much as that of purinaone urinary tract formula there are two cats in my house anabel has always seemed pretty disinterested in her food she will eat when she gets hungry enough but will often stop after just a few pieces treats make her sick however the first time i opened the bag of evo anabel started crying and milling about at my feet she absolutely gobbled the first few pieces i gave her then cried for more unlike other brands we have tried which make both cats sick unless we coordinate a very slow transition neither cat has had a problem with this dry food we could have fed them solely evo after just a few days but i do not want to waste what remains of the old food although the cats are enjoying evo so much that i am getting more and more comfortable with that idea update we finished up the old food and began using evo exclusively about two months into our experiment and at the same time anabel developed chronic diarrhea we switched her over to another premium dry food and the diarrhea promptly stopped unfortunately she is not as enthusiastic about the new food the other cat is still doing fine on an evo only diet but we will be transitioning both cats for simplicity is sake interestingly neither has any problem digesting the evo wet food ,1
i was skeptical about these chews i have two lb picky chihuahua is i have been looking for a replacement for their favorite treats that are no longer made i have tried quite a few in this process and wasted a lot of money because they will not touch them the himalayan dog chews are great they do not have an odor like a lot of chews they are very hard which means the dogs can chew longer apparantly they taste great because my dogs love them this is their new go to treat thank goodness my search is over i will be ordering again and again ,1
i really was wary about ordering this since i is picky about cappuccino but it is great i like my cuppuccino a bit sweeter so i add sweet and low packets per cup i am hooked now on this grove square brand it is great very smooth tasting and good finish ,1
i grew up in southern california so i have had my share of sweet corn cakes at local restaurants this mix is a great way to make these at home i prepared a package of these for a friend of mine who lives on the east coast and had never tried a corn cake she is now addicted but can not find them at her local store thank goodness for amazon ,1
i hate the new and improved stride which i purchased for years i do not like the foil wrapper or the taste of the gum flavor does not last i have switched to orbit white bubblemint yum ,0
i love this chai tea its really delicious and it does not get that burnt taste if you leave the bag in too long my husband does not even like tea but only requests this specific one i love the individually packaged bags worth the price ,1
product did not ship well pasta broken into small pieces flavor profile was poor i like the idea of low carb pasta however ,0
i really like chicago style popcorn this brand is pretty good big fluffy kernals and well coated no old maids it is not exactly the treat you get in chicago at garret is but it is fresh and very tasty garret is gallon bag costs compared to here it is a great treat to eat while watching a movie i think i have to try the flavors too ,1
this is an excellent soy free alternative to peanut butter i even bake with it i make peanut butter cookies that people would swear are real peanut butter with this product it is definitely not a no stir product though it does arrive separated the oil tends to rise to the top and so it does need to be stirred from time to time this is still a fabulous product my children adore it ,1
good and hot but also hot and good just a drop or two will do but this stuff is flavorful and hot the kind of heat that stays with you for a good minutes good in chili salsa sauces etc love it ,1
i would not buy this product again if it was free i followed the directions to the letter and all i got was a sterile cup of soil that ended up molding over time when i tried to contact gimborn pet specialties about it noone ever responded to my emails or letters ,0
and did not work in the keurig because of this do not send damaged goods i would say this was percent of what i received not all percent did not work but of the so far i tossed about of the first was good would have liked more flavored coffees ,0
i used to order these for my daughter and husband since they had grams of sugar in them which is comparable to the fruit chews you buy in the store but without all of the colored dyes sad to discover in my last order that the sugar is now up to grams per stick which is too much i confirmed with clif and they said they raised the sugar because that is what the customers wanted so we no longer buy these now just a note for those watching how much sugar their kids are getting ,1
this lavender is sooo good it looks smells tastes and feels good i use it to make skin products and in the few months i ve used it i ve seen remarkable results the delivery was fast i d by from this seeler anytime my only complant is they stopped seeling the half pound boo so like a tradder i bought some from someone else clamming super blue and found it wasn t as good as this was ,1
i am so glad i found this seller i just purchased my keurig about a week ago and wanted to try some different flavors without committing to an entire box it was fun picking out all the flavors i wanted to try if you go over to her website there is a much easier to read list of flavors and types of coffee that she has in stock after purchasing i immediately sent an email to the seller with my flavor requests i received an email response shortly after and everything was packed and ready to go less than three hours later how is that for customer service and the shipping was lightning fast i just received my package today monday after ordering thursday night all cups are accounted for and i am already enjoying one of the cups i received if you are new to keurig or want to experiment with some new flavors this is a wonderful way to pick exactly the ones you want ,1
this black tea from hong kong is infused with a nice natural mango aroma and flavor the reason i did not give it five stars is that the tea itself has a slight earthy flavor some people like it but i am not a fan overall this one is a keeper ,1
i picked this up right away when i noticed it was cheaper than anything else i mostly load my own freshly ground stuff in that kuerig cartridge or the eco cup the k cup coffee they sell in the stores sits there for weeks or months check the date in the square on the bottom and always buy freshest and it loses a lot of flavor i use the k cup coffee for emergencies until i get some fresh roasted beans so grading on the curve this stuff is on par with some of the staler k cups i have had i came at it with an open mind only noticing for sure it was instant when i took the cup out of the maker after brewing and noticed it was strangely light i peeled back the top and nothing it took my slow brain a minute to figure it out coffee crystals as good as starbucks instant i think faint praise but they do not tell you it is instant shame on them for that i will not be buying this again update september apologies they do tell you it is instant if you are good at reading fine print i have dropped my rating from stars to because the coffee is not really that good in fact i threw it away does not make sense economically even if you like instant coffee ,0
green mountain dark magic is bold and dark without being bitter thats why it is my morning wake up coffee ,1
good price perfect size small packages but the first box box box all were stale a first for an amazon food product it is happened with others selling on amazon but never a product from amazon bummer,0
these are so much better than regular paper baking cups i originally bought them because i wanted something that was unbleached more natural after i started using them i discovered that they are also much better quality than regular paper cups cupcakes muffins do not stick to the papers so you can actually eat the whole thing do not have to waste the part sticking to the paper ,1
this tea is so yummy a great alternative to caffeinated tea it has a bit of a cinnamony flavor it is a great price here on subscribe save and i do not have to go to the store to get it ,1
i first bought this at an unnamed big box store when i was trying to find something to help me cut back on the caffeine after a few months they of course quit carrying it sigh i do not buy many grocery items online but after missing my tea i found it here with supersaver shipping it was less than when i bought it locally it has a great mix of floral herbs fruits and spices although i do not pick up much cinnamon which makes for a lovely fragrance and taste and it has a beautiful light red color it also makes a really really nice iced tea barely sweetened for me it is perfection ,1
this is some pretty tasty italian dressing that is wonderful on any sort of salad unfortunately my primary use for italian dressing is to marinate meat and especially chicken the problem with is that it has too high of an oil content which causes the grill to flare up frequently blackening the chicken the generic brand from jewel works a lot better for grilling however the flavor is delicious and it is perfect for salads so if you do not plan to use it for grilling do not hesitate ,1
i used to buy this when i lived in maine years ago and it goes great with homemade baked beans i live in the midwest now and had forgotten about it until i saw an advertisement somewhere a few months ago my husband loves molasses and i thought that he would really enjoy this unique bread i was right he loves it we have cans left but he wants me to go ahead and order more i am wondering why they do not sell this nationally as it is so tasty i do not remember it costing so much when i lived out east and the next time we are out that way i am going to buy barrels of it ,1
the grapefruit and blackberry flavors are the current favorite at my house on tuesday nights when we try to always have a rotisserie chicken and homemade gravy while watching tv once you taste the subtle fruit flavors mingling perfectly in a not overly carbonated sparkling water you may want to order this by the case there are no artificial flavorings or colorings not to mention extra sugar the only sweetener is grape juice and apple juice concentrate lemon juice and fruit concentrates mingle with the sparkling water to create a delicate smooth slightly tingly and delicious drink perfect for drinking with dinner or taking along on a picnic the rebecca review,1
i had these shipped to my grandson in germany the shipment was fast and free cannot beat free the chips were great will order again ,1
this tea has a nice taste and is pretty comparable to the foojoy oolong which is what i have purchased in the past however one thing that should be noted is that the tea is caffeine free or at least that is what the individual tea bag wrappers state the product details on amazon is site do not list this nor does the box that the tea is packaged in ,1
very good however i am only one in my house and i had to buy to large cans it is way too much for one person ,1
good old mallomars we used to keep these in the refrigerator when i was a kid still a good idea if it is warm outside definitely a comfort food the packaging for the box i received as a vine voice was poor though sent in a padded envelope many of the cookies arrived crushed hopefully the packaging is better when ordered through amazon is regular ordering process ,1
i recently tried stevia in the raw because i found it at my local supermarket at a more reasonable price than my favorite nunaturals nustevia brand it is not as sweet as nustevia but i do not feel the need to use more than packets for my tea or coffee it does not leave an after taste unlike purevia and truvia takes more to sweeten the way i like i like the fact that it is easier to buy locally it keeps me from buying the artificial sweeteners carried by most supermarket stores when i can not get to a natural foods store i am on my box and i have not found any problem with clumping as some of the other reviewers have i live in a humid climate sea level we have a lot of moisture problems here if you can not buy stevia products locally it is nice to know amazon carries it i hope this review helps you decide ,1
takes an extra bottle shake or two to totally dissolve the formula but we like it and so does our daughter ,1
after my initial disappointment i contacted native forest and asked them about the sri lanka sourcing of coconut milk they informed me that they had already discontinued their sourcing this was around september and that the only remaining cans were those already stocked it now being february i decided to give them another shot i am so glad that i did too because theirs is easily the best coconut milk i have ever had now that it is properly sourced from thailand that is those of you who were concerned about getting any from sri lanka should be safe now additionally it seems that while they once were not accepting returns for this item you can get a replacement if the cans are dented and you call amazon and if they are from sri lanka you can be sure they are going to be dented old star review another warning for anyone who orders this if you get the cans from sri lanka they will be watery and they will be dented and they are not eligible for a return you have been warned ,1
as someone who has not been able to eat gluten for the past couple of years this chip brought back memories of my favorite everything bagels that i used to eat regularly they are quite delicious ,1
i have never been a dark chocolate fan i need either the extreme sweetness of milk or some other intense flavors to catch my interest this one does the latter very very tasty with a few different flavor notes great for your chocolate stash i picked mine up at walgreens ,1
when i purchased this i thought about a healthy smootie anywhere anytime but it does not taste very good not sweet and yummy enough sorry for being so technical ,0
with the summer heat a cool drink it what hits the spot you could drink something like snapple but at such a lower cost and just as good if not better are these crystal light drink mixes the fruit punch is a winner ,1
i did the job no moths for a weeks now the instructions are not real good but if you read them carefully and not drop the little tab through the hole but slid it under the tab until it drops it will go where it should go you may need to use the corner of the envelope the tab comes in to push it all the way through ,1
i was skeptical about purchasing a coffee specifically formulated for making iced coffee i mean i spent all last summer making iced coffee from extra bold k cups and they were very good so what is the big deal i will tell you i was pleasantly surprised i did not realize it before but the flavors of doing it my old way were not quite as rich and complex as these nantucket blend iced coffee k cup plus when i was brewing it my old way on the iced coffee setting and barely getting a cup full with the iced coffee k cups i brew it on the oz setting and get a nice big full cup of iced coffee with just enough room to add a little and sir in a generous spoon of sugar and you get an iced coffee better than the donut and coffee shops for a mere fraction of the cost try these you will love em oh and it might be worth noting for those of you who feel the same way and were wondering i do not particularly like the regular nantucket k cups for hot coffee ,1
i am not a tea lover in fact i have been a tea hater for most of my life until last year when i realized that it is black tea that i dislike not green tea anyway this is fabulous tea the best i have found i do not even have to sweeten it ,1
both kitties love these flavors grilled seems to have a sweeter stronger scent and they lick the plates for the gravy they do not llike other grilled flavors beef turkey so was happy to find these these are flaked and the pieces are moderately large they have ignored flaked food in the past so again this was a nice surprise ,1
this waffle mix makes great waffles the waffles are best if you use the add oil eggs and water instructions and not just the add water instructions hard to find in stores but well worth buying here if you can not find it locally ,1
here is the email i wrote to the lindt company after my first taste of the new version hello i have loved your excellence bar since i first discovered it years ago the slight tang of fruity notes was very unique and simply delightful also knowing that only the highest quality chocolate is made with enough cocoa butter to preclude the need for soy lecithin i was impressed that your excellence bar was soy free like many other americans i typically avoid soy for health reasons however your new version of the excellence bar is entirely a disappointment its bland flavor is not disagreeable but it certainly lacks the character of your previous recipe and i see that the quality of ingredients has also been sacrificed the bar now contains soy lecithin this chocolate no longer stands out from any other chocolate available on store shelves i will now be buying my chocolate from a different company but if at some future time you decide to resume your previous version of the excellence bar i will be pleased to buy from lindt again ,0
one packet one whole box of bombay potatoes is points on weight watchers often for dinner i will supplement with fresh spinach extra chick peas or chicken sausage this all makes for an extremely tasty low point dinner or lunch that does not taste like diet food tasty bites contain only ingredients that are instantly recognizable whole foods the potatoes in bombay potatoes have a great soft yet firm texture and the sauce is incredibly flavorful i highly recommend ,1
this review is for the peanut butter fudge cremes i love sweets chocolates cakes pie ice cream and cookies i was looking forward to trying these it is a nice package with delicious looking artwork depicting the chocolate covered peanut butter stuffed specialty oreo in all it is glory yum i could not wait to get it open and chow down on a few ok more than a few but who is counting right away i was disappointed by the fact the cookie itself is maybe half as thick as a ritz cracker maybe even smaller not much crunch going on at all and nothing much to chew either also the fudge to me had very little chocolate taste the peanut butter stuff on the inside was ok much like the inside of a peanut butter flavored m and m overall i just did not like this cookie much it is a fine product but just not my cup of tea or cookie now the rebuttal my father happened to be sitting there watching me test yeah testing the cookie out and wanted to sample same his opinion was much different than mine and said he loved this cookie and it was just right and then he grabbed my bag and made off with them so as you can see a good cookie is in the mouth of the beholder or the muncher as the case may be ,1
vegan organic kosher very hearty soup not thin or watery great tasting six star company just a wonderful vegan organic soup i enjoy with these,1
i really like the taste of this organic rooibos tea the leaves are a bit small but works wonderfully if you infuse it using a french press instead of using a meshed ball tea infuser i am from south africa and even thought i know people there like it with milk i would recommend it without milk probably personal taste it is a wonderful healthy alternative to any hot caffeine drink enjoy ,1
i found this recently at walmart and have practically bought them out it is the only worthwhile tea to drink in this country i am convinced that the only reason the us prefers coffee is due to the poor quality of tea available here anyway if you are used to the strong milky cuppa that is popular in the uk this is all you need ,1
i have been using this product for several months now my most recent purchase has an expiration date months in the future i will use the coffee before the month is up this has got to be the most convenient way to get the starbucks flavor at home or when there is no starbucks nearby for a pack of the cost per cup is below and you cant beat that ,1
i had been looking for a treat to provide my small breed dog during training excercises she adores the happy hips duck breasts i cut them up in small pieces and place them in the training bag i can get her to do just about anything for a piece of this treat i love that the treats are great for her hips and health as well ,1
this product comes fast enough and allow my mom to make her cakes more favorable the price is little higher than i thought ,1
my cats do not like most fish oil supplements whether human or animal grade my vet has recommended many that i have had to throw out because they were not palatable with this i can add it to my cats wet food and they do not seem to notice their coats are pretty shiny after using it for about weeks one cat has arthritis and fish oil supplements help manage her discomfort and this seems to work ok for pain management and mobility i am happy ,1
the best candy i have ever eaten i always request the butterscotch squares and nothing else whenever i am asked what i would like for any event or holiday i might go buy a box for my partner today and maybe a box for myself ,1
not only is this syrup hardly as natural as claimed it tastes terrible check out the ingredients and you decide how natural it is i will be sticking with pure maple from now on ,0
this is the second time we have ordered the tortoga rum cakes this one was pineapple it is so moist delicious not over powering in sweetness had it for easter everyone loved it had tried several others they make they are all wonderful a wonderful dessert for any holiday gathering a real keeper makes a wonderful gift too ,1
this was a bulk size of a product we use for grilling company sold rights so not available under this lsbel any longer this is the original version will keep me grilling steaks for at least years adds great taste to ribeyes i usually cook ,1
we had been using similac soy formula but found that to be giving our baby serious constipation so we switched brands and landed on good start we have had no issues with this formula i am mainly going to comment on price this product sells at walmart for per container considerably less than the price on amazon just a fyi ,1
i normally drink my coffee black but i discovered this combination at a station store this coffee mate flavor works great with torani sugar free caramel syrup to satisfy this coffee drinker is sweet tooth with coffee ,1
i could eat peanut butter by the jar when i am looking to lose weight this is the stuff to go to having to measure out the powder and water to get the right consistency keeps me from binging on it it is also fantastic to mix into smoothies or supplement powders for added flavor excited about the potential other uses for this product ,1
i am no cook so do not make gluten free bakery items normally sure i tried a few over the years generally they are not very good and the good ones i find are super expensive and require a special trip to a health food store what i can buy commercially already made up is generally pretty poor actually it is mostly down right awful and super pricey so when i saw these betty crocker gluten free bake mixes i decided to give them a try wow this chocolate cake tastes great and was super easy to make it is probably not as good as super premium homemade chocolate cake from scratch but it is cheap the ingredient list looks pretty good and it is very easy to make exactly what i would look for in a cake mix in a box i do not like the betty crocker gluten free frostings because of the hydrogenated fats so made some chocolate frosting from scratch it was pretty easy also and tasted great the second one i topped with strawberries and that desert chocolate cake chocolate frosting and strawberries blew me away it was so good thanks betty crocker here is the frosting recipe if anyone is interested ,1
this is top notch almond syrup we put it in lemonade and strawberries great for many uses also use in baking recipes ,1
the natural truffles have an unsweetened coaco powder on the outside with a nice smooth texture this is not to sweet more of a european style candy wonderful ,1
not really a good flavor if you are looking for something close to starbucks way to heavy on the pumpkin flavor not sweet enough maybe ,0
these fig preserves are the best i have been able to find and i have tried other types over the years i will not bother ordering or buying any other again they come very well protected no worry about breakage are delicious more fig than any other ingredient and spread beautifully yum good on toast with cottage cheese with meats over ice cream ,1
these lolipops are the best and so unique i first bought them in epcot in disneyworld in the mexico part of world showcase they are a little sweet a little salty and a little spicy the best at first there is a saltier out layer but as you keep eating it you get bits of sweetness the perfect combo ,1
well i dont know about the product itself but i do know you are better off finding a local indian asian halal market in your are and buying from there if you dont have one then this would be the way to go a better one would be asking a relative that lives in a larger city to buy you some and ship it ,0
if you enjoy cinnamon this is an excellent coffee it is smooth but leans toward a bold roast packed with a cinnamon kick ,1
this product has an interesting take on fries which i have always liked growing up the flavors make the fries even more delightful ,1
i tryed a lot of coffee they are all basice the same but i think nantucket is the best hope this help ,1
i have replaced sugar use with truvia and this is a great deal great to use in tea coffee or even greek yogurt truvia can be very expensive in the supermarkets so this saves you a lot of money i will be looking for this again when i run out ,1
even if i go to the local starbucks down the street and purchase this item it is still only friend good luck trying to sell this for over per can i do not even think someone in their wrong mind would pay this ,0
the tiny nuts under the overwhelming ball of chocolate is not of the highest quality they looked a bit old and you can barely taste the macadamias too much chocolate that is not very rich and for a dark chocolate way too sweet you are better off buying roasted macadamias and a good quality dark chocolate and eating them together in one bite ,0
those posting that these cupcakes are amazing must not know what homemade cupcakes and icing are the cupcakes are not bad not very attractive as the one posting commented but that is because i actually filled the cupcakes full like the box said and they overflowed would have been better had it said to just fill them half way and make more cupcakes however the icing was terrible actually inedible and i love desserts and sweets and icing and will try anything but it does not even smell like good chocolate frosting i followed directions precisely used all fresh ingredients bought the day i made them and i ended up using my own homemade icing with the cupcakes rather than throwing the cupcakes and icing away and for the amount of work for the cupcakes i would rather make some from scratch they would definitely taste better very disappointing since i typically love ina and have had some of her other box mixes which were excellent ,0
it was delivered faster than the number of days it took to eat all of them will purchase again soon ,1
i have used this tea for years i used to be able to buy it from my local indian grocery but they no longer carry it the best it arrived promptly and i did not have to go without ,1
we made this seasoning purchase based upon the item as pictured unfortunately the received seasoning is quite different from what was pictured to explain further lawry is made a significant change in their taco seasoning not for the better a number of months ago when they did so they also changed the packaging of the product we based our purchase upon the pictured seasoning the old and tasty seasoning yet what we received was the new and not so tasty seasoning which can be purchased at any grocery store not worth sending back but if what you are looking for is the good stuff avoid this one i finally think i am going to try my hand at making my own taco seasoning ,0
this is a great buy we are talking a whole pound here and packaged in individual oz packets to keep it fresh till you want it we have been paying at the store for small ounce bags so this is a great price as well besides all of that it is a great tasting product one of my best purchases here ,1
this has alot of fruit in it and is something different that is not outrageously priced i like the bluberry too can also be used as a holiday gift in or out of a basket as the packaging is abit fancier ,1
bought this spice first in the local food store then i ran out and could not find it anywhere so decided to look online this spice is amazing you must try it it is hot but not too hot so be careful not to put on too much unless you like it hot it has the right flavors to go along with any pizza but you can still taste the pizza and not just magic seasoning blends pizza pasta magic herbal ,1
tender bits are a variety of seitan wheat meat and replace chicken breast in many recipes they are best prepared sliced and sauteed until crispy with olive oil and garlic and spiced according to taste prepared in this manner they make an excellent topping for rice or pasta dishes and are especially good when finished with barbeque sauce what is great about tender bits is that they can be kept on hand in the cupboard instead of the freezer where many a package of seitan has met its untimely end ,1
after receiving a gift of delicious blueberry preserves from a speciality store i set out to find something similar in my local supermarket in particular i was looking for a product made from wild blueberries bonne maman is wild blueberry perserves turned out to be exactly what i wanted it is a very sweet jam that includes whole wild blueberries which are smaller than regular blueberries in every spoonful the preserves are easily spreadable and are great on toast but i have also found that they are wonderful for adding to plain yogurt or smoothies a delicious must have for blueberry lovers ,1
i had this sour cherry spread once and i went on a mission to find it in a local store then i remembered to try amazon this is the yummiest fruit spread i ever had then i tried the plum one umph they are both fantastic i bought the peach one too but i have not opened it yet i am guessing it will be scrumpdiddlyumptios too ,1
the bars taste good but they are really crunchy it is almost impossible to eat them and not make a huge mess of crumbs definitely not good for taking on the go to eat in the car ,0
in principle this is a great product it is actual fruit with nothing added dried to a crisp and put in a packet that only has calories if you are looking for light healthy ish snack foods that are still tasty this is a great choice but there are a couple of the packets are very narrow and long which makes it virtually impossible to reach into them to get the fruit out once you are past the top third or there is a decent amount of fruit dust inside which as these are berries and cherries is red and just waiting for a bit of added water to stain up any fabric it lands on either of these in isolation is no problem but put them together and you have got a product that you must pour out and yet a product that you can t pour out i guess maybe if you had a bowl or something it would not be a big deal but that sort of takes away the portable snack nature of it no as much as i liked the fruit the inconvenience of the packaging is going to keep me from buying more oh and one more caveat despite the cherry berry name this is at least apple i suspect that apples are to dried fruit mixes what peanuts are to mixed nuts the inexpensive and unobjectionable filler the apple tastes fine and all but i would not mind more cherries and berries and fewer apples ,1
i have been drinking earl grey for over years and sadly watched the demise of my favored vendors one by one after the last disappearance i tried the taylors on the basis of the reviews disappointment is not the right word it smelled strange out of the box and after brewing it properly discovered that it bore no resemblance to the dozens of different earl grey experiences i have had it is heavily dominated by the peaty nature of the chinese black tea base almost an oolong and the bergamot is barely detectable unique but not what i want de gustibus non disputandem ,0
the camp the kids attended this past summer did not allow peanut butter so mama had to find an alternative for two peanut butter loving kids i spent quite a bit of money on alternatives the kids always said yuck i was to the point where i was going to have to try to wean them off pb for the summer which is much easier said than done i took a gamble based soley on the reviews here we are now a sunbutter loving family the kids did not notice any difference we are continuing with sunbutter as it is a healthier alternative to pb now my kids can sit next to their friends at school who have peanut allergies i like the fact that you can keep sunbutter in the fridge or pantry even when i take it right out of the fridge it is still soft enough to spread easy on the bread ,1
this was a fantastic deal the average price per bottle including my free shipping option came out to about compared to in stores the shipping was fast probably due in part to the christmas season and they have proven to be a much more effective tool over traditional coffee when it came to crunch time for finals oh and no crash however with extreme use as in my studying for finals example there is a possibility of getting a headache but i suppose that could also be attributed to only sleeping hours a night all in all it is reasonably priced very effective and a great alternative to coffee ,1
 this is really good as noted by another reviewer this kit is not a meal in a box yet it provides the foundation for a yummy meal on the cheap when you can catch this on sale for less than two bucks a box you can not beat it it sold out quickly and was on back order with supermarket sales i stock my freezer with ground turkey beef and chicken the hard and soft taco kit allows me to whip up a meal that appeals to the entire family with minimal fuss and stops the teenager is fast food run i do season and warm up a can of beans black pinto or kidney that each can put on their tacos too i have not found any busted taco shells yet when i do i will make frito chili pie with them or a taco chip salad both can be eaten with a fork and savored using up the kit is ingredients the kids get the biggest kick out of tacos and kool aid the only hitch is that the sell buy date is within months so i donated some boxes to the local food pantry hoping it will be a pleasant change thanks to alan in idaho for providing the detailed directions belowdirections what you need lb lean ground beef oz shredded cheddar or mexican blend cheese chopped lettuce and tomatoes and sour cream it is not a complete meal in a box but does include flour tortillas for soft tacos hard taco shells see above about breakage seasoning for the meat tiny package of salsa and unsweetended kool aid mix you brown the meat drain add the water and the seasoning mix boil then simmer minutes meanwhile crisp the hard shells in the oven and warm the soft shells removed from foil packaging in the microwave total prep time is about minutes ,1
i purchased this for my husband because he likes the name brand ideal which is made from xylitol this is not the same as ideal the texture is different and it has an aftertaste it tasted like and the texture also reminded me of truvia which i do not like at all if you like truvia made from the stevia plant then this will work for you but if you are looking for something comparable to ideal xylitol this is not for you ,0
this is the closest stevia based sweetener to sugar i have found i have tried several and many have an after taste which i did not detect with truvia if there is a negative it is the cost easily it is the most expensive choice out there maybe it will come down with popularity but for now we just have to grin bear it to get a natural substitute without the calories or the frightening chemical concoctions ,1
i have ordered these nuts many times now they are the best honey roasted pecans i have had would recommend to all to punches from this company prompt service and reasonable prices will be back,1
the yeast works perfectly for my co generators on my tropical fish tanks my plants keep growing and growing they never looked healthier ,1
product got to me super fast and it is terrific high quality chia seeds and a great price as well ,1
i got this out of curiosity i had never even heard of cincinnati chili except at some american restaurant in shanghai and so the next time i was in the us i wanted to try the semi real thing i dig this stuff but it is not what your normally think of when you think of chili the main differences being it is much thinner more like a sauce with a lot of beef in it there is no tomato sauce and it is not hot the spices are a more subdued mix the most prominent to me being allspice and then cinnamon it is too thin to stand on its own so i have it with hot dogs and the norm is to put it on spaghetti probably any starchy food would work fine though trans fat has been perhaps correctly demonized lately so it is a little weird that each can has a couple grams it is not much but you think they would get rid of it anyway of course canned chili is not the height of the culinary world but it is about as good as any other canned chili i have had ,1
this is the best i do have to add a small bit of sweetner but it is worth it ,1
i ordered this item as part of an anniversary gift i was a tad disappointed since it looked smaller upon arrival than it did in the picture but nice enough for the price however i was thrilled with the shipping ordered regular shipping and it arrived the next day anyway wonderful ,1
this is by far my favorite brand of coffee and i have a keurig and a tassimo taste is smooth and strong a little bold ,1
the box contains empty chocolate shells the photo showed the shells filled with something of a lighter color which is misleading i bought this box as a gift to my wife who loved the heindl tourist chocolates during our recent trip to vienna the empty chocolate shells are good but she was underwhelmed ,0
we have been using this syrup for years and now so easy to have it delivered right to our door wife is diabetic and we really watch her carbs she is been able to stay off shots for years now with products like this we can not tell any taste difference from regular we used to before the new sweeteners came out we have noticed when we ask for sugar free syrup when we eat out this is the only brand restaurants carry ,1
twinings english breakfast tea is an excellent tasting tea when brewed with the tassimo system i would highly recommend both we usually purchase this tea in single packages at bed bath beyond a little cheaper with a bb b coupon but they do not always carry it amazon always has it in stock and offers it in double packs which is a definite plus ,1
i am a fan of the thai peanut sauce very much so i find it to be a delectable treat which i enjoy with my family quick easy you know ,1
i have arthritis and have searched for a decent coffee replacement for years the maya chocolate hits the spot the chicory gives it the bitter note needed the toasted almonds add depth while the chocolate tempers the chicory and adds fullness to the flavor whoa sounds like i am reviewing a great coffee lol good stuff manard give it a go ,1
much to my surprise this cookie offered flavor and such a moist texture i love the healthful ingredients the individual packaging works great for a lunch box or a purse i will order this product again without a doubt ,1
the description claims this balsamic comes in jars i should have examined the picture more closely this balsamic comes in a plastic squeeze bottle there are already enough health concerns around plastic containers without adding something so acidic to the mix combine this with the heat encountered during shipping and the combo only gets worse note that this item is not eligible for return either ,0
freddie loved it and the little bit that he left behind rufus a dog gobbled up i think the reason that cats love this aside from the taste is that it is nice and wet and mushy will buy again ,1
it seemed easy enough to make basically just dump the little granules in a cup and add hot water stir to dissolve it then attempt to drink not sure what i was expecting maybe something like tea or like lemonade it was neither it was lemony sure but it was also really spicy like hot spicy a bit like drinking chili pepper water not my cup of tea as it were if you really like drinking spicy ginger perhaps you will like this guess i am not much of a ginger fan for me i will stick with green tea or peppermint this just did not sit well with me ,0
decent price for a booster shot i can see it being bitter for some but i enjoy the taste of things that are healthy tip pour the shot into a cup of mineral water and you have a seltzer type drink that is absolutely refreshing ca not say that i feel different physically due to this but i am a believer in antioxidants and have been drinking green tea since i was a teenager would like to see the price come down ,1
our two cats thunder biscuit insist this is the best dry food on the market they recommened it highly ,1
great price and just a wonderful item came with few if any crushed always a great candy gave stars because it was packed great and good price ,1
great coffee variety for anyone with nespresso machines highly reccomend for everyone the flavors are amzing and give yout he chance to try them all,1
great nutritional bar that is good for breakfast contain lots of fiber and great for snack anytime will have to keep on hand great for weight loss as well ,1
my tigger was a kitten when he came to me dropped he loved the outdoors but often got into some accidents that ended up at the vet is office needless to say he then would not eat and was loosing weight i had tried other cat foods but nothing he would even look at then i tried petite cuisine tuna shrimp to mine and tigger is amazement he fell in love and eats well now he is now old and i have another dropped old male cat and he also loves this cat food tigger and ziggy are very happy cats ,1
with almost too few carbohydrates to count these little wraps are perfect for diabetics they come in assorted flavors but i can not taste the difference no matter as they serve their purpose in getting food into my mouth if you are like me avoiding all bread you will love these wraps for making sandwiches that will not spike your blood sugar count whatsoever ,1
unlike other reviewers i really liked the sauce yes it is a little sweet but i am a big jalapeno fan so i think it is great it is good to add to something like tacos or burritos and you can tell it is a taco bell product it is tastes similar to the other sauces that taco bell commonly puts on it is products it is not something i would use everyday but i would add to spice up a regular taco night ,1
best honey i have ever had i get four bottles every four months and always run out before my next shipment ,1
as a diabetic i am always on the look out for low carb snacks the dietician limits my carbs for snacks to between g my calorie pack of emerald natural walnuts almonds contains only of carbohydrates what a satisfying good deal i understand that most diabetics die from heart disease the box claims this snack has mg of to help protect the heart prevention magazine says you probably will not get enough omega from plant sources but i think it could help ,1
the coffee itself was great and at less then for over is it is a incredible bargain the main thing you should know if you buy it though is that although it is categorized under whole bean coffee it is ground it is also ground extremely finely to the point that a good amount of the grounds pass straight through my bodum classic french press filter it is more suitable to be drip brewed then made in a press edit apparently is categorized properly under ground now ,1
i have ordered baronet is dark kenya aa pods several times now and just love the deep rich cup of joe that my senseo can extract from these no complaints about the pods and their use with my machine however when i saw that the pods were now being offered in these smaller pouches instead of the wastefully overpackaged boxes i was intrigued my typical concern with these pouches is that if each pod typically is not individually wrapped they can grow stale if i do not move through them quickly enough since i saw in multiple places in the product description that these were still individually wrapped i decided to check it out sadly i must report that the staff at amazon goofed on this product description big time these pouches contain loose pods that are not individually wrapped while i love this coffee i will be switching back to the other packaging after i drink these up baronet please do not get rid of the individually wrapped pods in fact it would be great if amazon offered individually wrapped pods in bulk much like the each pod is a nice and rotund grams this product shrinks each to a skimpy grams yet each of smaller pods in less packaging are less the two cents cheaper than the bigger ones as such each smaller pod is not producing nearly as robust a mug double cup of coffee as the other version of baronet is dark roast kenya aa pods i guess i should have zoomed in all the way on the picture to read the fine print on the packaging or pulled out my calculator to figure out how many grams were in ounces ,1
i have been drinking tea for forty years and earl grey for almost as long i have tried every brand and was a devoted bigelow fan until i decided to go to the experts and had several different brands shipped from a shop in london uk the twinings was the hands down winner it is the most perfect blend i love it hot or iced and was thrilled to find it on amazon now it arrives on a regular schedule at an unbeatable price ,1
after reading several satisfactory reviews on amazon i purchased the zuke is turkey and taterz mini bakes my two dogs are not picky eaters and especially love turkey and potatoes my miniature poodle absolutely refused them my terrier took them in his mouth and immediately spit them out i have tried several times but the result is the same since the ingredients are all natural i took a small nibble myself to see why they taste terrible and the texture is awful this was a waste of money ,0
these chips are tasty but i am particular about the origin of the food i eat and did not expect these chips would be a product of thailand ,0
amazon allows a customer to purchase of these total yes you read that correctly for most babies this might last only a couple weeks who is amazon kidding why even offer it as a product at all i will give the revenue to diapers com instead since amazon will not take my money ,0
i am very glad my husband found this product it is low in calories adds a lot to our breakfast by way of being tasty and cruchy and serves as a good low cal snack i like it better than the berries which i find to be sour sometimes ,1
my toddler who will not eat beets will not eat bananas and will not eat strawberries loves this combo pouch the first time i gave him this flavor he cried when it was empty and kept demanding more i guess i will have to buy more ,1
these do not remind me of pretzels at all they may be crunchy but they lack anything in the center and remind me of really crisp thin crackers rolled into sticks if they were crackers i would not buy them either but that might be because i do not like really crunchy crackers but instead ones similar to the glutino original crackers or ritz crackers where they have a slight more substance to them ,0
it is the only brand and the only flavor my cat goes crazy for having it shipped regularly from amazon is one less thing i have to worry about finding at the brick and glass stores ,1
not many natural drinks that are energy focused have a warning on them for people with high blood pressure this one does since that is not explicit on the listing i was duped into getting this to review unfortunately i am not even going to chance it here is to full disclosure on products sold on amazon everything can not be in the disclaimer and most people do not read pages full of disclosures the least they could do is put a full copy of the product packaging on here since it is big shown clearly on the packaging ,0
i am finding that i do not want to eat meat most days i stopped eating red meat back in now i very rarely eat turkey or chicken even fish at times is just too much to eat i love having an alternative that i can use in recipes and it is very satisfying i would recommend giving this product a try i even put it in my tossed salads ,1
update and change of stars i bought two pouches of this and my dogs hated it my bosses dogs loved it some time ago i was low on treats and opened the second bag surprise all of my dogs ate it so i am now changing my review the treats themselves are a handy size the consistency is a bit like beef jerky so if you would like to give smaller treats they are easily ripped apart to me they smell like grain oatmeal but not like poultry ,1
my daughter is months old and has been struggling since the day she was born with constipation gas and reflux we have tried formula after formula after formula nothing but vomit and severe constipation finally we found a formula that helped with her constipation but she was still having problems with her reflux even with added rice the drs however continued to say she was at a steady growing rate so there was nothing to worry about well one day i ran out of formula and ran to the store to pick up some more fortunately the store was out of the similac alimentum nearing her feeding time i was in a rush so i glanced over the other formulas to find one that would be the closest match i just happened to pick up similac sensitive r s now not only is she not spitting up she is staying full longer sleeping through the whole night and she s not gassy or constipated hurray another minor pro is that it does not reek like the alimentum does kind of smells like vanilla flavored ensure i called all my friends just days after buying the product and recommended it to everyone i could not be anymore grateful ,1
the price was low so it was an acceptable risk to try it out i like jalepeno cheese and popcorn i like many kinds of flavored popcorn i like yaya is other cheese popcorn this jalapeno cheddar popcorn arrived a few days past the expiration date bummer okay so maybe it will be stale but who cares i will eat it i put a small handful of this popcorn in my mouth and it tasted terrible i kept chewing i had to give it a chance swallowed a little put a little more in my mouth and could not stand it any longer get it out of my mouth spit everything out it is the worst popcorn i ever tried the after taste kept coming back hours later and grossing me out my friend tried some too and said it was horrible the whole case went into the trash i was afraid to feed it to animals ,0
this is one of my favorite teas exceptional quality truly serves to keep me well and healthy the box set i purchased here is a great and convenient value ,1
first off i would like to say that the seller zamouri spices now has all my spice business their prices can not be beat and you can buy most of them on amazon i bought this spice for a moroccan lamb pie recipe that was published in bon apetit magazine it was so good i am thinking of having the recipe tattooed on my arm i researched this spice and found that reviewers praised this mixture from zamouri spices for the amount of spices used in the mix i found this to be true as i saw some that only used different spices where zamouri uses over twenty very flavorful results if you need ras el hanout this is the seller to buy it from ,1
i have so many dogs that i have to have alot of treats and this was a great deal for boxes we got the blue dog bakery natural soft dog treats peanut butter flavor softies boxes pack of each box is big enough for each dog we have right now to get a couple treats at bedtime which is perfect will order again for sure ,1
i do not know what it is with these gluten free mixes they seem to be good for one thing or the other but none of them are really all purpose i love the waffles this mix makes but not the pancakes i did not try making biscuits or anything other than pancakes waffles with it because i loved the waffles so much and after the pancakes were such a disappointment i decided to use it for what it did best from now on this is the mix i will use for waffles for pancakes i have enjoyed pamela is for bisquik like texture but add lots of vanilla it makes them tastier if i want denser healthier pancakes i mix my own mix based on a recipe in the best gluten free family cookbook by donna washburn and heather butt which requires purchasing specialty flours but it is worth it the specialty flours are more nutritious than the pamela is mix which is mostly rice ,1
i am an active guy and i have a ridiculous requirement for calories and protein the planters creamy peanut butter provides just this in bulk of course like most other modern peanut butters the planters variety is an unnaturally ultra smooth spread with unnaturally ingredients partially hydrogenated oils if it was natural there would be some texture and i would have to mix up the oils and peanut goodness every time i wanted to make a pb j as is i can just plop a clump of this beige yumminess right down on my homemade bread add some unnaturally sweet jam and voila i have a quick meal and most importantly calories if you are on a budget and can not afford the real stuff this will do but do not expect ideal health after consistent consumption ,1
i admit at first i was a little worried about buying gum from a warehouse i thought it may be stale or outdated but to my suprise the gum was fresher than packs i have bought at the store very good product ,1

this case of cat food arrived fast was very pleased with the company and included some samples of new temptations cat treats temptations are the only treats my cats will eat as for the cat food itself of the cats ate it but my finicky eater did not smells like freshly opened can of tuna ,1
these are even better than authentic kluski noodles i buy at polish food stores every now and then and they are suitable in a number of recipes they are not certified for passover a minor inconvenience ,1
i have dogs and both of them love these things they do not last long at least not with my dogs but they are great treats to give them highly recommend ,1
this is my favorite gum of all time i quit smoking almost years ago and i have tried lots of chewing gum flavors and brands this is the best and unlike the other orbit gums this one seems to last a pretty long time i am beyond happy that i can buy this on amazon and that it is prime eligible because i cannot find it in any local stores anymore ,1
as a vegetarian this item fulfilled my need for protein and also for something that resembles meat it is a great snack ,1
this purchase started as a way to get free shipping for an different purchase i love mangos the raw fruit is delicious dried makes for a tasty healthy snack so i figured i would give mango candy a try it is like skittles but softer without the hard candy shell the mango flavor is not as strong as i would like but it is enough to satisfy this is just candy afterall i engulfed the first packs while at work day one gave a pack to the boss who immediately asked where i bought this addictive candy guess i will have to give him another pack as another review mentioned it does have a slight oily feel but it did not bother me at all i think that is what helps it stay so chewy in short i like it it might not be for everyone but i will be buying more of this tasty candy ,1
i have found better graham crackers but these are quite good and we buy them frequently i like the new packaging since each individual package contains just enough for one time with the old packaging there would almost always be a few crackers left over and no way to seal them so they would start to go stale if you have never tried honey maid graham crackers they are worth trying and be sure to dunk them in milk coffee or tea as they are great that way ,1
i am glad to have gluten free rolled oats to eat i would very much like to have steel cut gluten free oats perhaps cream hill estates will produce that some day ,1

delallo got it right i tried the recipe on the box a vegetable lasagna the no cook noodles came out perfectly there are sheets in the box the each sheet is approximately x it works fine in a x baking dish at sheets per layer layers i am not a fan of whole wheat pasta i find the texture of most whole wheat noodles very unappealing the texture of the delallo noodle was smooth and cooked very well not having to prepare the noodles for the pan cut down on prep time too i will be ordering more ,1
if you like fruitips this is the exactly same candy that you are looking for i was not sure and gave it a try i finally found my favorite candy in amazon it is not an ordinary soft like gummy bear it is very chewy it is imported from uk with their favorite blackcurrant flavorit is not very sweet probably less sweeten than the us candy,1
unfortunately we can not get this product locally anymore and questions sent to old el paso is corporate headquarters indicates that they have really got no idea how their distribution channels work they can not even tell you if their products are sold in all of los angeles county go figure anyway if i can get it here i am happy i have tried a bunch of other sauces la victoria el pato and a few other off brands and the others are always too hot for the rest of the family i find the old el paso to have the proper amount of mild heat and the great flavor i could eat the stuff every day ,1
excellent and tasty though i thought not enough garlic so i added more when i order garlic i guess i expect more of it but perfect if you have guests as it will never offend anyone omaha always is sure to do everything to please their customers a premier company hard to find anymore ,1
it is beyond me why anyone owning a keurig coffee brewer would want instant coffee i usually read all reviews unfortunately i did not have time that day and did not want tomiss this friday special this is the way it was marketed to buyers on amazon grove square tm single cup coffee dark roast ct box i find this deceptive and unfairto unsuspecting customers this is instant coffee if you go onto amazon it now it states on someof the grove square products that it is instant coffee i use my keurig for makingtea and hot chocolate and have even bought the chai cups do not buy it is worse thanany instant coffee i have ever tasted and amazon will not let you return it does notdeserve the rating i had to give it to get this to post thank you and i hope this is helpful ,0
i swear my dogs eat better than i do and while my dogs are hardly picky they definitely love these treats i am a little curious about how there is stamp on the side of the bag that says it is not for human consumption if it is all organic meat with no wheat or additives why can only dogs eat them more of joke than anything just amused me but there are not a whole lot of treats in the bag and they are not cheap so i guess it just boils down to the question of how healthy should a dog treat be and honestly how healthy are they anyway over the next brand i do not know but my dogs like them and that is a success for me ,1
this food product is the best because when i get off school i just turn on my popcorn machine wait for it to get hot then i just cut the whole bag and the popcorn start popping in like to minute the popcorn taste good too the ingredients they put in the bag is just the right amount too when it is done you might see or pieces of burnt popcorn but hey at least it taste great,1
cugino is chicken noodle soup is pretty tasty i used to buy it at safeway but they do not carry it anymore so i am going to order it from amazon from now on i usually add more veggies to the soup in addition to the chicken to make it a thicker meal type soup i would definitely recommend this soup it is so good ,1

i really like coffee mates creamer the flavors are well developed and i have not had any bad creamer yet the convenient flip open access hole is great too for a dispenser ,1
i bought the vegetable soup at a county fair expecting a hearty and varied vegetable soup but the soup is misnamed it should be called potato soup because that is all that is in it this soup is expensive so you would think they would at least include a few veggies but no they would rather pack in lots of desiccated potatoes to fool the customer save your money ,0
i normally enjoy all of the kavli crispbreads and was really looking forward to trying this one it is light crispy holds up well under heavier toppings such as vegetables and is low calorie however i found this product to be too salty even for a confirmed salt lover such as myself the salty garlic flavor can overwhelm many toppings especially those already containing salt a fresh sliced tomato with herbs no salt is fine adding a little salted hard cheese such as parmesan decimates the flavor of the cheese i ordered a subscription because the price was fantastic but i will be cancelling it and replacing it with another kavli crispbread product ,0
i love regular merengue cookies and i normally do not have a problem with sugar free but these cookies had a terrible taste and worse texture stick to the non sugar free ,0
when in jamica years ago i ate jerk pork or chicken everyday i loved it and brought one jar of walkerswood home with me when my jar was empty i went to see what i could find at different stores the ingredients in the sauces i did not like did not even have similar ingredients to walkerswood while this product is full of flavor it is not overly spicy tablespoon will work for a pound of meat the jar can be used many times enjoy,1
i found this coffee to be very tasty we have a traditional coffee pot so i used a few packs per pot and that worked perfectly do not miss an opportunity to try this coffee you will love its smooth mellow flavor very good ,1

i have had coconut water many times i prefer it straight from the coconut the taste of this is the closest in tate it is very fresh and clean tasting very natural there is not container taste like some of the others if you are looking to try coconut water and want something that is truly natural and clean in taste this is it ,1
there is not a whole lot i can write in a review about this aside from it tastes awesome it is so good that it is very difficult to eat just one bag it is comparable to a cracker jack or carmel corn with a small amount of chocolate drizzle on it it is a very refreshing afternoon snack ,1
i am totally dissatisfied with my encounter with nutricity my order was late damaged and incorrectly filled nutricity was uncooperative and difficult with the return process and failed to either replace my order or fully refund the damaged items their attitude was that they just wanted to get rid of me and they certainly did ,0
funny name aside this is a cook is dream i was introduced to it during a cooking class a chef mentioned that butt rub has many uses beyond barbecue it is a great flavor enhancer no msg to almost any meal ,1
i love ginger anything this is a non alcoholic brew that offers two strengths of ginger i prefer the gram bottle snappy and bubbly it is my eye opener in the morning once you get hooked you will miss it when it is gone so i buy cases bottles at a time also is used for goosed up coctails in trendy bars try something different and give yourself the benefits of ginger in your life mildly spicy with a jamaican flare twist off cap so bring it with you if i have a little stomach queeze this drink will fix the problem ,1
reminds me of christmas with every bite nice crunch moderately healthy snack nice calorie packed option to all this diet fad no complaints ,1
it is tough to review a food product since we all have different taste preferences so i focused on how this compares to splenda since it is made by the same company i use splenda exclusively as a way to control caloric intake i like the taste and find it comparably sweet to sugar without an aftertaste such as equal and sweet n low have for me most importantly i use splenda because it has no aspartame which i am allergic to nectresse also has no aspartame but unfortunately i found it to have an odd and very noticeable taste i am not sure if this is the monk fruit or the molasses but it is distinct it was unpleasant and downright wrong in iced tea i dumped a glass made with it so i decided to try it in plain greek yogurt i normally add splenda packets and a scoop of sugar free jelly to my yogurt i did the same with the nectresse the odd flavor was still noticeable though not unpleasant with the jelly just different however i also found that it was not as sweet i think another reviewer may be right this is more fruit sweet with a hint of tartness than sugar sweet the nectresse comes in thicker foil lined packets like the splenda essentials do i find these inconvenient you can not easily shake the product to the bottom of the bag to open and it is not as easily opened either overall this is not bad per se and could be an alternative for those who do not like splenda but need to avoid aspartame i would hazard a guess that those who prefer splenda will not like this i will finish the sample package i was sent as the taste is not as off putting in fruit based items like herbal tea or yogurt but i would not buy this regardless of the price ,0
over the past years i have fed my dogs different dog foods i previously fed my dogs blue buffalo lamb but after or months i was not happy with the results and the dogs did not seem to like it very much i then switched to natural balance dry dog food grain free limited ingredient wanting to see if feeding them a grain free product would help with their shedding after about a year i again was not satisfied with the results large and soft stool and no help with the shedding my next dog food was nature is variety prairie they like the smaller dry kibble and i liked the technical information about what to feed them looking for a certain range of protein and fat by using an independent dog food advisor site also through my research i noted that nature is variety was noted to add probiotics to enhance a dog is digestive functions and also include certain minerals that make them easier to absorb enough technical though my dogs really like nature is variety prairie and their stool has improved shedding is still an issue and both my vet and groomer say some dogs just shed regardless of what you feed them my dogs have been eating nature is variety prairie for the past year i have very large mixed breed rescue dogs so we do go through a lot of food each month i love getting it from amazon on subscribe and save mainly because the price was right for a very good quality food and it arrives at my door with free shipping and without me having to think about it at all my dogs eat slightly more than pounds each month so every months i need to order an extra bag so i never run out yesterday i went online at amazon to place my extra order i was surprised to see how the price has increased over the last few months going from in may to in august to its current in september this price has now increased to more than i can buy it locally and i no longer have the tax free in california unfortunately i will either change again or just buy the food locally since i do like nature is variety i am considering one of merrick is dry foods as i like the fat to protein ratio of about but i hate the gradual process of switching dog food ,1
love it much better than a similar product from costco the flavor is smooth and rich i just wish this was a little cheaper then i could drink it every day ,1
i use this product on my body and hair it is the absolute best it moisturizes like no other i use it on my hair as a light deep conditioner i put it on my hair before i wash my hair like a hot oil treatment i just let it marinate in my scalp and stuff and then i wash my hair it leaves it soooo soft and it even detangles and it leaves my hair feeling strong and it is growing but be careful if u use too much on ur hair it will become very very greasy and heavy u only need a tad okay next i use it on my skin i wash my face and i put it on my face afterwards it leaves my face feeling extremely soft clean and moisturized also it doesnt clog my pores and once or twice a week i will do a soothing bath with the coconut oil a warm bath mixed with the oil is sooooo heavenly lol also use it when i shower too it leaves my skin feeling soo soft like i have eczema and it doesnt irritate it at all my skin loves this stuff it melts fast and the smell will takes some getting used to i havent tried cooking with it yet because i really just wanted to use it on my skin cause i have extremely sensitive skin and eczema and i needed something pure and organic and honestly i can see my skin clearing up my eczema is less itchy and actually looks better and is under control coconut oil is so vital to my everyday skin care regimen best thing ever ,1
this oil is nice very nice to cook with the spout for the product is messy and drips down the side of the can but we bought an olive oil carafe and use that now ,1
this stuff was sooo goooood it made the house smell like brownies and we finished the bag in about three days will buy again once i can afford that kind of coffee habit ,1
i purchased this product for my brother is birthday as was forever saying that he thought chocolate covered bacon sounds so delicious i knew the vosges milk chocolate bacon bar would be in bar form as it says on the website but what i did not know is that the bar contained very very tiny pieces they turned out to be grains of bacon sparsely distributed after my brother open the gift revealing the chocolate bacon bar everybody at the party started laughing telling me that i was scammed i was utterly humiliated look at the photo of the piece of bacon on the box that to me infers that there is a piece of bacon inside that is covered in chocolate quite frankly i would not complain if there were at least bacon chunks inside the bar of chocolate not so i am now on the hunt for a recipe to make chocolate covered bacon at home i am not much in kitchen so this is a real chore for me and it is highly unlikely i will be able to make it myself like i said i am not much of a cook boooooooooo ,0
this mushroomy mix of dehydrated veggies and spices makes a sauce that you might have in a village restaurante of the wooded hills of tuscany comes with real mushrooms and well proportioned spices and vegetables that simply need to be reconstituted in cup of boiling water add some olive oil to saute a couple of minutes then add some tomatoes or canned tomatoes cook it down for about minutes at a medium flame and serve over penne or other pasta that was cooked separately this is real food for people and a gourmet meal that will beat what you might find in your local italian restaurant my family absolutely loves this mix ,1
i live on an island in alaska so groceries are unbelievably high a can of asparagus in the store is you can guess how often i buy it at that price so as always i went to amazon and saved approximately a can we can all eat asparagus again and not feel guilty this is great asparagus not full of hard crunchy pieces trust me we are ordering and reordering ,1
i ordered the babycook but when i received it it looked as if it was a returned item the packaging was opened and there were scuff marks on some of the parts i re ordered and i hope that the one is brand new because i really would like to start using this i have heard great things about this product but my rating was based on how i received the product and not the product usage itself ,0
this product is a very health snack for your pup as it is made of beef liver my puppy does all of his tricks to get this treat it is a little pricy but the container is large so it should last a long time as long as you do not overfeed ,1
okay okay i must admit i was skeptical after years of drinking coffee and than having to stop oh my goodness i thought i would have a melt down i tried several coffee alternatives and each time i was so disappointed so much so that i gave up looking knowing that i would have to get use to drinking pero you feel my pain right last week i was introduced to ayurvedic i was beyond shocked can i just tell you it was like an answer to prayer seriously this coffee alternative is so close to the real thing that if i were blindfolded i do not know that i could tell the difference thanks ayurvedic for restoring my faith ,1
purchased and sent these to my year old mother who is very picky about what she eats and many other thing i got the good son phone call from her thanking me she now goes to a specialty store to get refills who knew crackers would make me the number son ,1

point buck sauce is great i tried to stop by the factory store in panola la on a recent road trip and it was closed for memorial day i was bummed it is thicker than regular hot sauce has great flavor and is not too hot ,1
there is some variation in the crunchiness of the peas some of them are quite hard not hard enough to break your teeth though as one reviewer mentioned there is also some variation in the hotness every so often you will get one that is very strong i wish they were all really hot overall these are very tasty and an excellent snack food ,1
from what i heard the basket was nice and delivered on time but the recipient had no idea who sent it despite my well worded thank you note the gift was a small token of appreciation that i had entered in the appropriate box on the order form there was nothing included the recipient eventually called amazon and found out who had sent it this was embarrassing and a let down on what good service i have grown to expect from amazon ,1
great product it has ruined coffee shop chai for me too much sweet and not enough spice this is the real deal i like a lot of cardamom and cloves so i sometimes supplement the mix a bit but it is good as it is when prepared according to the directions i admit that when i ordered this item i was not aware that it required stove top cooking rather than just a simple brew plus milk but the result is well worth the effort i now make it in a big batch and it keeps well for a few days in the fridge ,1
one of my dogs tore his acl and had to have tplo surgery which has a recovery period i knew i needed something to keep him occupied so i ordered a bunch of made in america treats off of amazon this one is his favorite he was so excited when i was opening the box he spent a hour chewing on it and was a dog again i was so happy to find something he enjoyed so much since he can not run right now he growled at his sister the whole time to make sure she did not steal his rawhide she got her own rawhide and also chewed it for an hour it was a nice break for me because i did not have to watch him so much while he was enjoying his treat i am glad i have of them we may actually make it through the with these chews ,1
we really liked this coffee it smells great and the taste is rich intense smooth and delicious brewing instructions state that two rounded tablespoons should be used per cup which is way too much unless you want to grow hair on your chest another tip some reviewers have mentioned bitterness a pinch of kosher salt added to the coffee grounds which counteracts bitterness after drinking this i am looking forward to trying the caramel flavor however the price of this small oz bag is way too expensive and i can find equally good coffee for half this price at my local market ,1
this greens superfood is the best it tastes really good and its real good for you get some today do yourself a favor ,1
there is nothing like a nice refreshing glass of cool water on a hot day however in damp foggy san francisco i do not necessarily find myself craving as much water as i should ideally drink in a day and while i seek some flavor to my beverages i do not want to indulge in too much sugar caffine or calories consequently i have been addicted to the little powdered drink packets designed to be used with half liter bottles of water when i saw this product on the grocery shelf i immediately wanted to try it it has several advantages over the powder packets in my mind first you can flavor any amount of water whether ounces or ounces also you do not need a shakeable container with a lid mixing up the mio beverage can be accomplished with a squirt and a swish finally you can flavor to taste and make your peach tea a little stronger or weaker as you like it all of these anticipated benefits have indeed proven to be true but what is more important than everything above is taste my immediate response to my first taste was this tastes like artificial sweetener it was not the most positive first impression but as i continued to drink and got used to a new flavor i found it palatable enough nothing to rave about but good enough for me to keep drinking the peach tea does have a nice tartness to it that i like as for other pluses and minuses well this product is very portable but it is more likely to spill or leak than a powder packet that said the bottle design seems quite secure and i am not especially worried about that happening finally the bottle promises that it can make up to servings but you have to read the fine print to see that a serving is ounces and it is very likely that your beverage serving is considerably larger than that so figure that into your math when you consider the economics of this product as for me i like it enough that i will try a second flavor and see what i think of it happy drinking ,1
this honey is good but i can not understand why the price is changed so frequently one month ago i bought it at subscribe price this time i bought it at subscribe price but now it is from the price aspect i do not recommend it ,0

i have purchased these olives from amazon in the can they were excellent though roland still sells the cans amazon decided to stock these plastic tubs instead bad idea mine arrived with the top completely off the cardboard box soaked with brine and of the olives in the moldy cardboard box the entire mess was unusable amazon did their usual great job of customer service we received an immediate refund but the trashcan got the olives not us i would give this sad mess zero stars if i could last sad little detail is the big ready to ship label on the top of the container it clearly was not ,0

stevia is a natural sweetner that is so much better than putting sugar andcorn syrups into your body i love the vanilla creme flavor we use it inour coffee for a special treat it is good in anything where you would use sugar ,1
we have tried several different brands of dry dog food for our girl a mutt if that matters but the one that stood out time after time is purina is beneful line it has ingredients we can be comfortable with and more importantly our dog loves it and is quick to finish the bowl we have tried a few different kinds of beneful just for variety and she eagerly devours them all i am well aware that it is not going to have the same nutrition content as the pricier all natural organic etc brands but it is kept our dog healthy and her coat shiny for seven years now so we are sticking with it ,1
the noodles came out gummy and they stick together and clump i thought i just overcooked them at first but the second time i cooked them they still came out in clumps but were too toothy you will notice that the cooking water becomes very murky while cooking it too and so maybe the noodles are just too starchy i will never buy these noodles again but they get stars just because i love this company and their approach to food ,0

not good at all my family and i are big mac cheese fans we like the other chef boyardee pastas but this was no good very little flavor and super runny stick with the kraft easy mac much tastier and just as quick ,0
my dog loves these and they are my training treats of choice i have only tried the chicken flavor they are semi moist not messy and pretty small they are not scored but can still be halved or quartered with a sharp knife or a long fingernail each piece has calories for med small dogs you can cut them down into really tiny bits and still make a dog happy if you quarter them you could give rewards during training and only be adding calories the bag has a reclosable seal and you will need it because they dry out and get hard and crumbly if left exposed if i take some with me away from the house i put precut treats in a snack sized zip bag to keep them fresh they also come in a larger sized bag which is more economical ,1
my got the first round of these as a gift and i was elated to find them on amazon they are wonderful ,1
i think this arrived around a week after i had ordered it when i did it was on sale and less than per bar i expected some of the bars to be broken since the chocolate in itself is crumbly and prone to breakage the packaging it came in was a bubble wrapped box that had been obviously thrown around but i do not fault the company pharmacy place for that of the flake is packaging unraveled so when i opened the box it showered my desk with chocolate specks and bits i then checked the flake to see if it had actually come from england and was not arabic seeing that many people on different flakes had gotten the arabic version rather than an authentic english version to my surprise it did not appear to be from any place other than england though a quick peek at the expiration date explained why it was on sale it had expired about a month before shelf life is not what it is now so i do not really worry much about that instead i did a taste check the flake itself is a bit older than if you had bought it from a sainsbury or another in england but the taste was not compromised it still had that chocolatey and tarty flavor that i had grown to love though the chocolate was not as glossy as it should have been had you bought it from england so they get stars for expired candy for slightly stale but for fast shipping if you could get this for a bit under per bar then i would highly recommend it but if you had to pay nearly for just flakes i would wait until it is on sale since this is not the best quality that you can actually get but to actually get the addicting flake in the usa rather than in europe i would buy this again and it is a great gift to give to your friends who have not tried this candy yet ,1
we have cats one of which started having stomach issues about a month after she traveled eight hours and moved into our house we thought it might be the stress of the drive the change to a new habitat and a new cat friend she was throwing up frequently and also having issues on the other end i will not get into the gross details a trip to the vet got her some antibiotics that helped for a short time but she was back to being miserable and obviously uncomfortable with using her litter box not two weeks after seeing the vet since we found this food and transitioned her on to it she has not thrown up her other issues have cleared up too and she is feeling healthy and happy again so i will say it again thank goodness for this food ,1
these ginger snaps are gingery tasty crisp gems i am so glad to have found such a delicious replacement for the wheat laden variety now my only problem is getting the family who do not have to eat gluten free to leave me at least one ,1
i fell in love with passion fruit while in hawaii and have been trying to recreate a salad dressing since i came home this puree was the missing link the shipping is pricey but the product is well worth it ,1

i received a sample courtesy influenster well i did not have the pleasure to taste it myself because my son got ahold of it and started munching away he absolutely loved this cookie and that is saying alot since my son can not stand raisins period i guess i am gonna have to add this one to my grocery list ,1

i love these they are not easy to find for sale in the storesdo not confuse these with m m coconut these are much betteralmond joy pieces taste wonderfuli would recommend themi like them because they have tiny shreds of coconutwhich is not just coconut flavor like the other brandi would give stars if they came in dark chocolatei keep and eat them in the fridge freezer,1
i have a jack russell terrier who may be the quirkiest dog in the world i tried giving him half of the treat and he would not eat it however he would not let go of it or let it out of his sight i crunched it up for him on the grass and he spent about minutes eating it and looking for every crumb my dog is not a foodie so these biscuits must be good i think that even half of the biscuit may be too big for small dogs so just crunch them up as i did ,1
this is great coconut oil that we have been using for a year now we love using it for high temperature cooking when olive oil and other oils are not appropriate to use and also especially on our popcorn coconut oil is so good for you and tastes delicious this product is wonderful too because it is organic extra virgin and very consistent in quality we are really pleased with the pricing here at amazon and the customer care when one container arrived to our house punctured and broken amazon immediately sent out a new container we will definitely order nutiva organic extra virgin coconut oil again ,1

ok i admit i did not actually try these myself however my son really loves them i was suprised to see the negative reviews of this product as they seem very appetizing they are a nice green color and the mint adds a good smell to them it is actually hard for me to find veggie only no fruit organic baby food at my local grocery store i really like that these are a way to get my son veggies that he likes the packaging is convinient it reseals well in the fridge i also find the pouches great for throwing in the diaper bag when we go out they are a bit pricey but i think worth it for the convinience and the quality ,1
this is a good tasty juice it contains acai berries that are known for the antioxidant abilities i drink it every morning it nicely stabilize my metabolism i like this flavor the most it is less sour than the original flavor ,1

delicious my first time making cotton candy and using this sugar and it is everything that i hoped it would be i am trying to find the same sugar that karmelkorn uses for their cotton candy it is not exact but this is pretty close ,1
i am not a huge cookie fan i like my desserts fruity cheesy or frozen with chocolate fudge on top the one exception is ginger snaps i like them even when i am not in the mood for something cookie ish i like them with tea i like them with coffee i like them with pepper jack cheese everything goes with pepper jack also because they usually are not terribly sweet and when i go to the trouble of baking them they seem to last longer than other cookies i mean they still taste good the next day not that i can resist eating them all straight from the baking sheet but these ginger snaps are not right they are chewy and gritty stale but burnt in places i know it sounds like a manufacturing problem and i thought perhaps the unburnt not stale ones would be okay if they were rebaked nope i picked through the bag to find the snaps that were not burnt i put them in the oven to are crisp at a low temp for about five minutes in the end they still tasted bitter gitty stale and overly sweet the price is right at around a bag but i think you would be better off buying an old tried and true brand such as nabisco ginger snaps sweetish super crispy reliably cooked for an even crisp texture or anna is ginger thins my new favorite store brand of ginger snaps they are wafer thin spicy and go well with ice cream ,0
when hurricane irene hit new york we lost power but still had a stove that worked this kit provided a quick and easy and quite cheesy meal essentially all you add is browned meat and water the macaronis are simmered in a seasoned water for a little over ten minutes then mixed in the browned drained meat a packet of velveeta is stirred in the meat and macaroni mixture everyone loved it except me no i was not expecting haute cuisine but i though it could have been less salty and more flavorful it does taste like a cheeseburger it is designed to please as opposed to challenge in fairness everyone else thought it was absolutely delicious to the extent that they went out and bought ten boxes it definitely benefits from serving with a nice crisp salad or jazzing up with some hot peppers tomatoes and or salsa this is ideal for the busy family college students or any one looking for a filling flavorful easy to prepare meal ,1
we really enjoyed the quality and taste of this product if you do subscribe and save and have free shipping its a great deal ,1

i usually buy the amish red popcorn but since i could not find a great deal on it i decided to try the sweet baby blue this is a great buy and it is great popcorn prepared in an oil popper crisp not a lot of old maids and they are almost all partially popped so they are the best part and very tasty i like this product as well as my usual amish red it may not be as crisp as amish red but it is close enough for the great deal ,1
i know it is subjective but i really liked the taste of this water and i liked how the bottles were shaped not too tall so you do not accidentally knock them over but still an easy enough shape to grasp this water ranks right up there with fiji water for me i bought it because of the supposed high silica content which is supposed to help get aluminum out of your body it has a number on it to call for a water purity report i might call and get one to review ,1
dolce gusto is a great system and great tasting coffee unfortunately the capsules are more expensive they could be ,1
product was exactly as it was described i am a regular purchaser of christmas puddings and this was very good was sent promptly i would order from this company again ,1
this keeps me from getting stinky i however have an issue with the moisture of a roll on tends to give me a rash and so i use tom is of maine stick deodorant first and then apply this one on top the stick creates a barrier that keeps me from getting a rash and the roll on keeps me from getting stinky only thing i have found so far in the natural department that works for me ,1
i love maldon salt i discovered it when we visited england and had carefully hoarded my box until my daughter when visiting england brought me back a box maldon salt is large square bowls of salt mixed with big broken chunks perfect for on top of bread or vegetables this box will last a very long time making it a very affordable luxury ,1
i like regular strength coffee and cappuccinos lattes so i use one of these dark pods while pushing the cups button on my senseo maker it costs to do this rather than use of the regular senseo pods and it is still very yummy the flavor is strong but not burnt and is a great everyday coffee ,1
what a great product priced to perfection the only one i use have been using it for years and will continue as long as it is available and at it is reasonable price ,1
it is true they are not k cups but this chocolate is very good ,1
considering the extra that one pays for organic products this product did not deliver for one thing it did not pass my smell or taste tests thyme is a fantastic herb and i expected the organic to be even more robust than non organic i understand that it is dried for packaging but even so i did not expect to have to struggle so much to extract it is aroma or develop its flavor profile in my dishes non chef that i am i have been around the kitchen long enough to know what i am working with when it comes to my favorite herbs and spices this brand does not measure up ,0
we love this and use it as a sugar substitute in just about everything beverages desserts cooking it is not at all bitter even in hot drinks like coffee for baking there are good substitution charts online that tell you how much stevia to use per cup of sugar if you need to replace the bulk of sugar in a recipe you also have to add homemade apple fiber to make it work my kids do not notice the switch and i feel good about using it because it is all natural ,1
if you like this tea you have to try the double bergamont which is fantastic i have tried many many types of earl grey over the years and the double is the best ,1
yuck i usually love sprout baby food and was so disappointed they are roasted so it is a orange mauve color which is okay but the flavor is really sour and strange there are better options for stage bananas i think i figured out why it is so bad i think the bananas tasted like they were really green when they roasted them ,0
following a plant based diet i use tofu almost daily it is expensive to purchase at a store and takes up valuable real estate in my fridge these packages sit perfectly on a shelf they are a little smaller than standard refrigerated tofu oz vs oz they are also silk tofu so they do not hold their shape as well which is good for certain things like fried rice or chocolate mousse not great if you are making tofu steaks or strips ,1
i just love this tea it has a really unique taste and i love the smooth coconut flavor if you like coconut then i totally recommend this tea amazon has it for a great price as well it is usually per canister in the grocery store ,1
i loved this as a kid and i still like it today what other food on earth could you eat straight cold out of the can and it still tastes good its a nice quick meal and fills me up better then a can of soup ,1
first of all i agree with the other reviewers way to expensive here on amazon you can save at least if you pick it up a your local sams club that is where i got mine sad to say since amazon makes it so convenient with that out of the way lively colombian by folgers should be categorized as a medium dark roast to me not everyone has the same taste buds but i found it to be a wee bit on the bitter side even at the largest cup would i buy this again yes i do not mind it being a wee bit bitter but in my opinion colombian coffee should be bold smooth tasting not bold bitter i know diedrich colombia coffee has that bold smooth taste i prefer there must be something in the word lively that folgers put on this box to indicate that it may be bitter like i said not everyone has the same taste buds so if you are the least bit hesitant about the word bitter i typed here i would suggest you get this k cup in a variety pack first instead of buying this count then regretting it later ,1
postum has been brought back to the market and is available online if anyone is interested in the original recipe postum it is only available on the web at the moment but has just been reintroduced back into the market long live postum ,1
i had been looking for individual packets to carry with me in my purse as when you eat out or travel you do not have to be with out the price was great ,1
i too have noticed it not showing up on shelves i was at woodmans grocery store in beloit wisconsin and cleaned off their shelves at for a container no one is selling the sugar free anymore and the sugar looking aid is just too sweet anymore does anyone know if it is being discontinued ,1
this cereal tastes very good similar to frosted flakes with a distinct honey and nut flavor although i did not really taste the peanuts because the peanut flakes on the cereal are so small i consider crunchy nut more like a dessert cereal than a good for you type cereal because of all the sugar and high fructose corn syrup in the ingredients even though it is fortified with lots of vitamins a c iron d etc it is calories for a oz serving without milk for me crunchy nut has a star taste with star ingredients ,1
order placed august pakcof cans ounces i have purchased this cat food several times in the past and my cats loved it however the last shipment on august disappointed me and my cats the design of the can has changed but that does not bother me i am very unhappy about the food itself it is now almost liquid and does not really fill up the can while it used to be solid firm all the way up to the lid like a good pate cat food should be my cats do not even like it anymore i would like to know if other buyers have noticed the difference or if by chance i received a shipment that is under par i certainly will not buy it any more and will no longer recommend it to anyone i would like for amazon to forward my comment to felidae why did they change the formula and make it worse changes like this damage a firm is good name in general best regards vera mottino,0
i bought a lot of boxes of vita coco from amazon these past few months due to the sale special offers lately boxes both were the small size tasted great carton had a weird taste i said whatever and bought the larger size yuck i drank the first two and they tasted sour i compared them side by side with the other vita coco i had the smaller cartons and these taste really different i opened a few more to try and some were okay and others sour ugh i do not care how good some of these boxes are if they vary this much it is not worth it to me to try again edited to add i emailed vita coco and told them about this and they told me they had a bad batch the rep then mailed me a free box of cartons this batch was good they sent me some funky flavors instead of the original though still nice of them ,0
there are a lot of garam masala blends out there this one is absolutely delightful i will order again the larger package next time for sure ,1
this is a wonderful blend for iced tea it is so refreshing just by itself but garnished with a slice of peach or mango and a sprig of mint it is also dinner party worthy white tea is one of the latest health kicks as well so you can not lose i also have brewed it extra strong and cooled it then added sparkling water and some honey and served it as a light punch again garnished with fruit and mint ,1
it is fragrant and delicious in the warm months i make a whole pot with one teabag and add a little bit of honey then let it cool and put in the fridge and drink ti as iced tea i love this stuff and drink it every day and buying it from amazon in this pack for is much more economical than buying each box individually they run about per box in new york city ,1
i bought these not realizing that they were not the regular clif bars i should have known because they are much too cheap the original ones but i was pleasantly surprised with these they come in packs of two and they are like a regular granola bar as compared to the soft chewy consistency of the original clif bars i loved these though and the white chocolate macadamia nut was so yummy i would definitely buy these again great value but very messy so definitely not recommended for a breakfast while in the car ha ,1
this coffee is good but strong if you do not like it on the strong side use less i would purchase this again lynnita,1
this product was packed nicely and arrived in perfect condition taste great has a long shelf life so you can use these for topping individual servings of a sheet cake or cupcakes i am impressed with these decorations they seem high priced but go buy them at a store or speciality place i am very happy and they traveled a long way to get to me the colors are vibrant and i can not wait to put these on my sheet cakes ,1
new improved recipe not really ovaltine should go back to the original formula new formula has more sugar less vitamins if your on the same page call ovaltine to request the original recipe call ovaltine,0
i was recently given a box of these gourmet jelly beans by a friend and do not think i will be eating any other jelly beans for quite some time i love the fact that they are created by david klein the inventor of jelly belly which david is no longer affiliated with a few of my favorites coconut just the right amount of creaminess and tropical flavor david needs to make a pina colada based off of this blueberry all the berries in this box were wonderful the blueberry is particularly tasty cranberry love the tartness balances out all the sweetness peach i am just a sucker for peaches pomegranate made with real pomegranate juice really does taste like it not overly tart just right root beer i felt like i needed to put a few ice cubes in my mouth to make it like a real root beer classic looking forward to seeing what david does with these flavors i know there is a lot more from where these came from ,1
like so many others i had this tea on my first visit to ireland after my first cup i thought this is pretty good after my second cup later i thought this is pretty darn good the next day i bought a box to take home then i started asking friends and co workers to bring an extra suitcase on their trips to ireland over the next years i heard the same story from many others here i asked a friend to bring an extra suitcase i am really happy that this tea is available here now and my wife and i travel nowhere without bringing a sufficient supply of barry is as it really brightens our day in a way that is unmatched by any other tea or coffee for that matter this is the tea bag version so some loose leaf tea drinkers may suspect that the bags are filled with floor sweepings as seems to be the case with many other tea bags not so this is the good stuff although if you want the hassle you can get this in loose leaf i prepare it in a krups coffee maker this and a few others have the correct water temperature set a timer for minutes in good water brita faucet filtered which beats bottled mountain spring water for taste really and costs per gallon do not follow my example and be led into a life long addiction stay away from this tea o ,1
what is the product celsius green tea raspberry acai not to be confused with the new berry acai flavour from absolut vodka which is equally delicious what is it all about it is supposed to help you burn up to calories more than you normally would with just diet and exercise alone this is always a tough thing to measure because with diet and exercise you are going to burn calories but this product claims that it can help you burn more just by drinking it how do they do it well it is probably because it is got caffeine in it but it is got a lot more than that aside from vitamins like c it is also got riboflavin niacin biotin pantothenic acid which just sounds cool to say calcium and chromium but it does not stop there add in a proprietary blend of taurine guarana green tea caffeine glucosomethingorother and ginger extract and you have got a drink that really packs a punch how does it taste actually it tastes great you can definitely get notes of the green tea and ginger so if you love ginger tea you are going to find affinity here too but the flavours are all light they do not overpower each other and they do not make for a drink that you are going to want to water down seriously i can see this becoming the next red bull type product mixed with the aforementioned vodka perhaps delicious absolutely energizing absolutely so much so that i had one of these at about and was up until full of energy so depending upon your lifestyle needs you could drink these about any time during the day and feel great enjoy it ,1
i bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and i enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials my cats did eat this food in fact they really enjoyed it however after reading the ingredients and doing some research i completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats the first few ingredients are which indicates the most prevalent ingredients are water sufficient for processing liver wheat gluten and meat by products by products are not even a real meat by products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested we are talking beaks chicken feet eyeballs even chicken poop i would not recommend this product it is just not a good quality cat food i suppose you get what you pay for i think the only reason why it was cat approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because i usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy i recommend to stay far away from friskies as it is simply a very low quality filler food even though the price is quite inexpensive your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food because they will never feel full cats need to eat real identifiable pure meat and there just is not enough real meat in this food when purchasing a cat or dog food the most important thing to consider is the first ingredients just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself provided that you eat a typical not vegetarian or other restricted diet now that i know what to look for i usually buy my pets all natural foods such as natural balance blue buffalo halo or wellness all of those brands contain real whole meats that i myself would eat with no added fillers or low quality foods ,0
i tried out celsius raspberry acai for about a month a can a day not sure if it helped me lose any weight my pants are actually a bit tighter than a month ago but that might be from all the easter candy typically i have an energy drink a few times a week usually diet red bull i found the celsius to be a competent replacement for my energy drink fix it has a decent amount of caffeine to inspire me to get out of bed and go to work the taste is decent though not overly impressive hints of fruit but slight sugar free aftertaste and when i put it in a wine glass and swirled it around i found it had good legs and a pleasant aroma it did not have enough carbonation for my tastes i like a bit of a carb bite along the lines of red bull my wife actually likes the taste more than i do overall a good energy drink that does the job tastes decent low calorie ,1
newman is special decaf is one of my favorite decaf coffees for drinking in the evening the flavor is rich and can fool many into thinking they are drinking caffeinated coffee there is no aftertaste and never keeps me awake overnight ,1
i love scharffen berger chocolate and this bar is no exception the flavor is rich and deep if you do not like coffee it has a strong presence though not masking the dark chocolate itself this is a great snack on its own and good in desserts as well i recommend it ,1
my girls a year old mini dachshund and an papillion mix love all things chicken they literally turn their noses up at most beef based treats they already love zuke is chicken mini naturals so i expected them to go wild for these z filets nothing doing i am not too impressed myself compared to the product description basted chicken filet what we received just does not match up i expected something chewier textured meatier and tougher what i found was not a filet which implies whole cut but a soft patty a pressed ground bits if i did not know better i would think it was veggie based i should have read the reviews first though i thought i could rely on the official product description and the overall excellent reviews these treats are described as ridged to help naturally clean dogs teeth and gums to promote healthy oral hygiene but what i received in the package which looks just like the package depicted is a thin flat and very soft which could not help clean teeth especially when they are not very chewy which does not matter anyway since my snooty dogs will not eat them i suspect their reticence has to do with the strong garlic smell coming off the patties i think it stinks but that is never stopped dogs from eating things before i even expected them to perhaps think i was giving them people food since our food is highly seasoned they did not buy it it is likely not chicken y enough for them who can tell i will not stop ordering zuke is products but i will be careful to read how reviewers describe them as opposed to promotional copy ,0
i agree with the writer who suggests making it a topping for hotcakes or waffles i however use it straight i also suggest buyers look on the dutch gold website for recpies my office loved the roasted walnuts topped with buckwheat honey ,1
a very good product the entire family uses and likes this product very well satisfied,1
the product specs describe it enough and so have the other reviewers it is a hot breakfast cereal best to add just a pinch not more of salt when you cook it to bring out all the flavor when done add milk i like it just right not too thick and not too runny then a dash of sugar or some splenda especially on a cold winter day you have yourself one of the healthiest cereals around for sure ,1
very similar in taste to eight o clock coffee and an excellent price purchased mine at a local outlet store that sells a lot of amazon overstock products and stumbled across this brand would buy again directly from amazon if i can not find locally ,1
i would recommend this tea it has a fresh taste with an amazing acai grape flavor that i have not had before it also gave me energy which i can always use ,1
the quality is excellent it does not take to cook and it tastes great i definitely will buy it again ,1
this tea is so good and i have a hard time finding it for a good price i love to buy it from amazon and get the whole case and have plenty and at a fair price ,1
wheat free natural ingredients easy to chew dry by itself but is good with coconut oil and or fruit spread ,1
while i imagine that these,1
okay first the tea is terrific since we all have different taste buds flash back to grade science class with the litmus paper test where half the class tasted bitterness and the rest tasted nothing o so people will have different reactions obviously this is one of the best tasting teas period the ginger pear hints are phenomenal and even the smell is incredible before the tasting experience having said that you need to know if you are doing price shopping amazon is wrong w the tea bag count there are only bags not hence it would have been cheaper other websites so very disappointed ,1
i bought this product and the soda stream jet just to experience the healthful benefits of sarsaparilla the word imitation does not appear in the product description the motto do not squeeze use fee is makes it seem even more deceptive what would i otherwise have had to squeeze imitation sarsaparilla ,0
it tastes fine to me but my son will take spoonfuls then spits it out green beans and spinach he can not keep down hot or cold he does not like this i still try now and then hoping he will change his mind he is months now since we started him at months and still does not like this he does like steamed green beans i cook but not this i have mixed this with other foods is the only way to get him to eat some because i know its good for him good price and value but not worth it if your child will not eat it ,0
i am a working mother and have been pumping milk for my daughter for over months i have gotten busier and busier and became concerned when my milk began to taper i use these supplements every time i start to see a lull in my milk supply i usually take one a day at night and use them during the day if i plan on pumping regularly i do not take a whole lot of it just enough to keep myself pumping between and oz per day it has worked wonders for me i only wish i had this after my son was born my milk dried up really quickly when he was around months and he had to drink frozen for the remainder of his first year luckily my daughter will have much more milk due to this product i would recommend it ,1
mmmmmmmmmm the smell and taste of this is just a perfect to warm up on cooler fall days i am so glad my husband does not like pumpkin so i do not have to share it is a light roast coffee so i do not want to water it down by brewing too large of cups but a nice medium cup of keurig coffee has a perfect smooth easy taste ,1
this is really really hard i use it for baking and for topping treats like cakes yogurt etc this does not work well at all ,0
i knew i was rolling the dice with this mixed grab bag based on some of the positive reviews i took a chance could not be more disappointed one third of the k cups are the cheap grove square brand some of which i immediately through away because they shook like a rattle with a dried up chunk of coffee in them the others sound like they have about a teaspoon of dried up indtant coffee grounds in them no comparison to any of the other k cup brands grove square sells for approximately half the price of other k cup brands in retail stores that is because it is instant coffee designed to look like a k cup makes the purchase price of this mix really steep since one third of my k cups were these cheapies i tried them once before and to me they are absolutely undrinkable should note that the product picture and written description does not show or mention grove square as one of the possible brands in the mix i also got teas decafs and about flavored coffees overall a horrible mix that was not worth the price i paid wo not risk it again unless you like the taste of instant coffee or are willing to overpay per cup to get to try some other actual k cup brands in different flavors do not buy this ,0
cloves have many uses they have an outstanding antibacterial properties and also anti inflamatory properties as well as a refreshing quality you can put it on cuts toothaches and even sprinkle it on your toothbrush when you brush your teeth there is nothing wrong with the flavor of these cloves just be aware that ground cloves do not have as long a shelf life as whole cloves be sure to use by the best by date stamped on the bottom of the bottle which is quite generous also i have heard you can extend the shelf life by placing in the fridge ,1
big disappointment since it tastes like plastic save your money this seasoning does not taste like salt and vinegar wish they offered some type of refund on the unopened bottles ,0
i have been waiting for years for something like this to come along hazelnut coffee is my favorite but it is so much work to find a nice hazelnut flavored bean so i would always just add flavoring to my coffee the only problem is that the creamers liquid and powdered have so many calories sure there is the sugar free torani syrup but it takes a lot to get an intense enough flavor and it is a bottle no thank you i just use packets of the splenda flavoring per cup and it makes the best flavored coffee i could imagine the flavor is intense and delicious and the product is quite reasonably priced since a good review must have pros and cons the only thing i do not like about this product is the plastic wrappers which never seem to open very nicely but all in all that is a pretty mild fall back this is a wonderful product ,1
boy am i so tired of reading reviews bemoaning the ingredients in dog food these days all the whiners claim that such and such is too corm or soy heavy or that it is not gluten free or some other such crap guess what it is dog food for the love of all that is holy would you tools quit your whine fest and go away for the record this product did exactly what it was supposed to do do you know what that is it fed my dogs furthermore they all seemed to enjoy it and have not shown any ill effects or digestive ailments not a single degree higher on the dog fart scale so i am happy sure our dogs are our babies but the same people who cry about dog food ingredients are the same ones who took the score out of childrens sports and think everyone is a winner total and complete imbeciles beneful dog food by purina will always be welcome in my home it hits a proper price point that others seem unable to reach our pets are only given a short time with us on this planet so why not let them enjoy their little lives to the fullest give them what they want if this dog food makes them wag their happy little tails then have at it i found this to be a great product and i hope you do to the naysayers need to get a grip on reality or just raise children instead they do not deserve dogs recommended ,1
unbrewed leaves had a hay smell i tried it anyway brewing like black tea awful then i researched tea and found different varieties require different methods of brewing since there are few variables i decided to expirement before tossing this out tried sun tea better but with an off taste then i tried hot not boiling water for a short time perfect brewed exactly right this is yummie ,1
we were having trouble finding the bagel chips in the grocery store when we wanted them so i decided to take a change and order them in bulk good decision they arrived in great condition and are all within a reasonable fresh date would i do it again yes ,1
gin gins are a great throat lozenge for coughs so much better than drug store medicated throat lozenges these have all natural ingredients also gin gins candy help with morning sickness during the first few months of pregnancy very good quality ,1
this is my first time trying coconut oil i was happy that the oil has a very mild flavor i did try cooking with it by adding some to butter when cooking eggs i did not taste any coconut so i was happy with that overall it is a good product because it did not have a strong taste and i will be purchasing it again ,1
we found these little mixes when we needed something for my daughter is gluten free diet these were easy to fix and did not taste like cardboard there are more gluten free foods and mixes available in our area now many very good but our local store that carried chebe mixes folded we were so pleased to find we could order through amazon and enjoy them again prepare one package for a smaller amount or you can use two for a large family like ours great ,1
their web page on amazon com is extremely misleading it implies that for you get a when it is actually only a single bottle single bottles on amazon are available from other vendors for only,0
this coffee has a full bodied flavor without being overwhelming it is not too weak or acidic like other decafs i have tried i will definitely buy again ,1
my daughter purchased this product as a clearance item at a local dept store it is easy and very tasty the container makes poping it a one step deal when we have the bag pop corn i need to put it in a bowel so as not to burn or get my hands greasy the kettle corn is not to sweet or salty my dogs love it also ,1
i stopped eating peanut butter for several years when all i could find had cottonseed oil in it i am deathly allergic to cottonseed oil it is put in peanut butter to keep it from separating i kept reading labels after about years i found some from bama i ate that for several years but it was discontinued oh no no peanut butter again shortly thereafter i found the smuckers which i buy at walmart supercenter because it is cheaper i saw the price here freaked a bit i buy jars at a time some crunchy some creamy seem to eat most of it right out of the jar while watching tv i love the stuff smuckers sells a lid with a stirrer in it for about a heavy table knife works just fine flipping the jars helps too the oil is also great for chapped lips ,1
this is my second order for this stuff it is great and cheaper than those single serve bags need to put these on my auto order ,1
what is the worst part of eating gluten free the sandpaper feel when biting into those gf brownie mixes this mix from betty crocker breaks that mold the brownies from this mix a moist and just sooooo good the fact that i can buy a case from amazon is even better ,1
this is my favorite beef jerky i eat it for a protein snack after working out and it is very satisfying high protein low calories and no preservatives or nitrites it is also cheaper or the same cost as other beef jerkies that are worse for you i have a subscription and plan to continue it for a while ,1
never ever again i will purchase any other pasta i did not imagine that there can be so much different in taste but it is de cecco pasta especially the farfalle are the best try them and love them for the rest of your life ,1
i thought i would try these out after reading an article about tony packo is and i was not disappointed these are awesome the pickles and peppers have just the right amount of sweet and tart almost like eating dill and sweet pickles at the same time and then throwing in a little spice for good measure i usually only eat pickles or relish on a hot dog but i put this on everything hot dogs sandwiches hamburgers side dish or just as a treat they are almost addictive i have been out for a few weeks and still think of them fondly as a matter of fact i am going to finish writing this and go buy a couple of more before i forget ,1
this company makes all their food with the highest natural ingredients i was worried my cat would not like this but he gobbled it up instantly my cat has a sensitive stomach and this food was easy to digest and did notupset his stomach i highly recommend this ,1
i absolutely bleed this tea i enjoy the balance between the bergamot and citrus i take mine with plenty of milk and a single sugar i really drink alot of different earl greys and while this one tends to offer some subtlety in terms of traditional boldness when compared to other rich black teas it offers a little something that the others do not perhaps thats what makes it so enjoyable but i find the infused citrus essence simply delicious ,1
while i have enjoyed fruit and black cherries all of my life and eat them while in season i noticed after eating a reasonable amount on two separate occassions how good i felt no joint pain but then after a day or two the joint pain came back i could not find cherries again at the supermarket so i tried black cherry juice organic knudsen is in place of the fruit within a day i started feeling great again so i drank a small amount each day during the day a bottle lasted a week and continued to feel fantastic when i went back to the store to buy more they were completely out and all the other juices in the same brand were fully stocked so apparently i was not the only one who believed in this cherry juice i have tried tart cherry as well but it does not seem to offer the same relief i will now stay as stocked as possible on this juice ,1
i was reluctant to try twinings lady grey tea because though i do not dislike it earl grey is not a particular favorite i do however like citrus and was in the mood for a lighter tea so i gave it a shot i really like lady grey it is wonderful hot and quite refreshing when chilled especially on hot summer days if you find the bergamot in earl grey overwhelming you might want to try this one it also has bergamot but it is much more subtle twinings considers lady grey to be a light tea and i can drink it in the evenings without it interfering in any way with my ability to sleep i prefer all teas black and unsweetened and this has a slightly sweet taste as is i drink a lot of tea and i make sure this one is always on hand it has a unique taste that i enjoy very much give it a try you might like it too ,1
i really enjoy this tea i still do not understand their spicy version though as i think the original is richer and just as spicy this is a concentrate that comes in a gal jug which you can add to steamed milk there is also a dehydrated form which you only need add hot water that is much more expensive but good for taking to the office or on the road ,1
i love the mushrooms and have ordered them in the past but half the cans come in badly dented if only this problem could be fixed i would keep ordering ,0
this product arrived on time and does what it says it will work for you just as well as it worked for me ,1
this is the best shredded wheat i have ever eaten it has no additives which makes it important to eat prior to the date impressed on the top of the box this also makes ordering this product through amazon is subscription service ideal because on each order i have received the imprint date is at least months in advance the bisquits are round like little hay bales and kind of crinkly this is especially good because they provide a crunchy oral satisfaction if you do not let them sit in the skim milk too long this is a personal preference for those who like soft cereal the flavor is just as good if the bisquits sit a little longer in the milk and by the way i use no sugar and the flavor is excellent they are especially filling for the low calories involved in fact they give satisfaction on many levels i have given boxes of them to my cardiologist because they are so wonderful they are perfect for eating a healthy diet no additives as well as providing that satisfying crunch i hope i have made clear they are not like any shredded wheat i have previously eaten my daughter introduced them to me and i pray barbara is continued production the company also makes bite size bisquits which i am sure are just as good i happen to much prefer the crinkly little bales yummy ,1
this stuff is truly amazing very tasty indeed the corned beef was tender and good flavored without being too salty the potatoes were billed as reconstituted but i could not tell overall the hash was quite light in texture as advertised i am assuming that half a can is a serving they are not saying the stats in grams are pretty darned impressive saturated fat fiber protein and sugar try throwing a can of this hash into a large cast iron skillet add some diced pickled beets and yellow onion and stir fry with a ration of butter congrats you have now made a fairly respectable red flannel hash ,1
obviously organic items are more expensive than non organic but the subscribe and save deal on this chicken broth is a great value the broth tastes great low in sodium and comes in convenient cartons highly recommended ,1
i was very unhappy when this package arrived at my workplace the bags were not wrapped for shiping and was damage in route when i opened the box the baking soda was spiling all over the place i could not identify where the many holes were and did not have acess to a container to put them in so i threw it away i made a mess all over the place what a waste i will not be ordering from this company again ,0
this quinoa pasta is a good approximation of whole wheat pasta in terms of flavor and texture it holds sauces very well and it is extremely easy to digest ,1
great if you have kids who want soda all the time just drop a fizzie into water club soda works even better and watch the tablet dissolve ,1
these are great ridiculously addicting good sense makes some of the best yogurt pretzels around the ounce bags are perfect i keep a bag at work and with the built in seal they always taste fresh ,1
this is a great tea chest it holds approximately tea bags more or less depending on the size of the bag the latch holds nicely and is easy to open the wood is very sturdy and nicely polished all in all it is a very handsome and useful tea chest i am very happy with this purchase ,1
if you like indian food this is definitely a great base to start with we have made have made it with chicken but i have been told that it tastes really good with other types of meat and vegan options i called this a great base as we have added some spices milk coconut milk and or different configurations and surprisingly enoughthey have all been been very tasty my wife is learning to like spicy foods and she really liked it she did think it was a little spicy i grew upeating very spicy items and i thought it was perfect and delicious i recommend giving it a try it is relatively cheap for what your get i recommend getting some garlic naam or pita bread to go with it hope this was helpful ,1
great tasting coffee i use this in a plunger and it makes nice strong tasting coffee similar to an espresso machine i would def purchase this again ,1
i liked this goji berries taste very good clean it keeps me full i will buy this again,1
i love this boxed pasta dish just add your kraft salad dressing and this makes a great side dish for bbq is and pot lucks i have started using the kraft fat free italian dressing and i can not taste a difference love this stuff ,1
this toy has worked out well for our dog we try to buy interesting and safe toys for us to give her while we are at work it is tough and has withstood our large bernese mountain dog puppy chewing at the neck of it and throwing it around the room it took her a few days to figure it out i had to show her how to use it and she seemed uninterested but then i left it in her crate with her and when i came home later it was empty since then she is a pro at it the rope did not last that long but we just took the rope out and use larger treats with it and it is still a challenge for her our last thing that we tried in it was baby carrots she loved it and it took her a good minutes to get them out ,1
i am a tahini lover and where i currently live it is hard to find so i turned to amazon and decided to try this brand knowing it came from lebanon tahini country it is not only the best tahini i have ever had the price for two of these large size jars is simply amazing and for the people who cry about it being too thin stir it up that is what you are supposed to do with tahini it is great to drizzle on salads and over falafel i keep my opened jar in the refrigerator and it thickens by the time i get to the bottom i just love the nutty taste simply delicious that is why i gave it stars far exceeded my expectations yes three whopping tablespoons to a can of chickpees along with seasoning of choice my secret is a good sprinkle of cumin a splash of olive oil and lemon juice till the right consistency makes hummus to die for happy eating ,1
i was not sure what country style meant so i looked it up these are large sheets of flat bread that can be stored in the cupboard and used as needed all it takes is a few seconds under the cold water tap on each side five minutes in a zip top plastic bag and the bread is soft and ready to go besides great taste you will get three grams of fiber three times as much as two thin slices of white bread in each third of a sheet and thanks to the whole wheat you will also be getting the vitamins e and chromium copper and phytochemicals that are milled away when flour is refined my only remaining question is whether it can be used dry like a cracker i was not able to find that so i will continue to buy just the plain ,1
if you love chocolate you will love this cake mix it is very moist and chocolatey with a hint of orange i served it at christmas and added a chocolate icing to it everyone raved about it and several asked for the recipe which of course is a secret family recipe the mix is simple and the price is fantastic i am really glad to have found canterbury naturals on amazon i have used many of their mixes and they are all wonderful ,1
 hey just because this is a highly recognized readily available brand does not mean it does not deliver the goods according to scott roberts who is scott roberts i did not have a clue until a recent npr show it turns out that he is the unofficial head of the chili heads the hot sauce movement on my own i have been taste testing hot sauces unaware of roberts or an entire movement of chili heads i have purchased about hot sauces and began taste testing them day after day week after week writing up notes everyone needs a hobby what i found is cholula is one of the best and it is in my top four btw make sure you don t purchase one of the cholula variants that add lime or garlic to the mix get the original these variants are a bit heavy handed and lack the fine balance of the original sauce taste i would call this sauce low to medium heat you will need a few heavy drops for a bloody mary and much more for a family sized dish but it is not so hot that a few extra drops will ruin a dish it has a nice blend of tastes and as noted has low to medium heat it has a hint of sweetness and overall this blend is just about perfect however unless you have taste tested a number of different hot sauces you may not appreciate how good and well balanced this one is it simply does its job nicely adds some heat to a dish without adding any off tastes if you have taste tested a number of hot sauces you will detect just a hint of vinegar but no where near the overpowering presence of this stuff which ruins so many other hot sauces tabasco franks etc there are a dizzying array of hot sauces available on the internet but most are difficult to find and expensive to purchase given shipping costs this sauce is readily available not just here on amazon but also in your local grocery store too that fact alone should encourage you to try it my three other favorites are the often recommended huy dong sriracha hot chili sauce readily available on amazon and in stores el yucatan jalapeno hot sauce and tabasco is chipotle sauce the sriracha is far hotter with subtle garlic notes the el yucatan jalapeno has the freshness of jalapeno peppers and the tabasco chipotle has the concentrated sweet smoked taste of the chipotle pepper these four recommendations really represent a very wide spectrum of hot sauces with fundamentally different tastes yet each in their own right is superior for about why not explore this universe of hot sauces by trying all four advisory this sauce does its job quite nicely which is to add some heat to any dish does it magically make a mediocre dish better no what it does do is add some heat without introducing off tastes now to many that may seem to be a given but the truth is very few hot sauces actually do that one last tip this sauce is sold in a oz and a much larger size and these larger sizes are often the far better buy and a final word of warning watch out for sellers that get to the top of amazon is sellers list by offering a low product cost and then make up for this with high shipping charges on a per bottle basis regardless of how many bottles you order at one time check your shipping costs just prior to confirming your order they may be much higher than you were lead to believe even if the seller publishes a shipping chart ,1

i bought this for my girlfriend as she had been having tummy issues and she absolutely loves it now it seems assumed i will keep her in stock that alludes to a completely different product review the point is buying it in bulk grants the obvious versatility of making tea bags when on the go or strainers when home it seems very economical without sacrificing quality in the least my only wish is that they would institute the subscribe and save feature here for those who are hooked and are loyal customers my gf usually gets what she wants ,1

with the new scare on arsenic levels in rice i did several hours of research and found that different parts of the us that grow rice had different levels of arsenic in the soil which the rice then soaked up i am feeding my month old son brown rice cereal and am very concerned about the arsenic levels i read about i bought this brand and after learning the rice they use is grown in texas and that texas is listed as one of the higher arsenic levels i am returning this product and purchasing bobs red mill organic brown rice farina this rice is grown in california which is listed as the least arsenic levels almost undetectible i tried quinoa and my son did not like it he is a little too young for oatmeal but that will be our next adventure just thought you would all like to know this information good health to everyone,0

i am an avid home cook and purchased this product as a thickener where the addition of heat is not desired example i make my own mustard and after accidentally over diluting it with wine i used the product to get back the thickness i wanted i have also used it to thicken a thin barbecue sauce recipe i make to help the sauce cling better when grilling and it worked very well also it does not seem to change the taste but the texture does change somewhat and is agreeable or not depending on the desired viscosity of the product you are trying to create my mustard was less creamy than i would like but still very satisfactory especially when i used the mustard in a sauce where it added additional body to the final result i have not attempted to create sheets or dehydrate films but am certain that my uses for it will continue to expand the downside and reason for the stars there are no directions recommendations or suggestions with the product at the time of my purchase even the willpowder website gives only scant information but that could change in the future perhaps there is an assumption that only professional cooks will be using the product and no guidance is needed as a result of the lack of directions on my first use i started with a scant teaspoon and then rushed to add more when it did not thicken immediately just to discover that it takes a minute or so for the product to take full effect resulting in an over thickened product because it is so easy to over thicken my suggestion is to add very little at first slowly then wait several minutes to see the results before adding more until you get familiar with the product characteristics i plan to keep ultratex in my kitchen at all times as a very useful product and staple one jar should last a long time for the home cook with moderate use since scant quantities are required ,1
i sent both the toasted and the fruit marzipan to my mom as a birthday treat she is a marzipan connoisseur and says they arrived beautiful fresh and delicious a hit thanks amazon for carrying this fine kosher product and thanks biermann is for an amazingly speedy overnight delivery for the standard delivery cost ,1
we recently adopted an obese pet and were looking for healthy dog food that could help him lose weight the ingredients seemed great but this food made our dog vomit daily and have very soft bowel movements times per day the food did little to help with weight reduction even with all the vomiting and we eventually had to switch to a veterinarian prescribed food instead note our dog does not have a hypothyroid problem after we stopped feeding our dog this brand of dog food his stool has become firmer and less frequent and he is no longer vomiting on a daily basis as i stated above the ingredients seemed very healthy and nutritious but i would not feed this to my dog or recommend it to anyone else ,0
believe it or not this pasta does not need to be boiled in water all you do is soak it in regular tap water and then cook it as desired we had ours with pesto so we put the pasta in a saute pan covered it with water and let it soak for approx minutes then we poured the water down the drain added our pesto sauce along with about a cup of water you will be able to tell how much water you need to add if any and heated it in the pan for a couple minutes that was it the vermicelli was almost exactly like regular pasta only a tiny bit chewier i would definitely buy this to keep on hand when we want pasta fast without having to wait for a pot of water to boil my only complaint is that the instructions on the package were very vague there are two recipes on the back but they do not give amounts for anything not even the amount of water to soak the pasta in you will kind of have to keep checking things as you go along ,1

i love loose leaf tea the large leaves brew slowly giving flavor but not bitterness it has a subtle quality about it that sets is apart from the grounds found in tea bags this tea does not have that quality rather than whole leaves the tea is ground up bits like in english breakfast tea even after brewing the leaves are tiny chunks rather than a long slow brew i found that this tea takes on a bitter edge after as little as two and a half minutes i usually brew tea bags longer if you keep the brewing short and use a lot of leaf to compensate it can be drinkable but why bother when you can do better with a bag i will not be buying this again ,0
i try to avoid having too much nutrisweet aspartame the sweetener in most diet drinks because it can make me feel crappy after a while but i have always loved the little crystal light powders similar to these so i finally went on the hunt for an alternative and decided to order totally light win they are just as good at crystal light and theyr e sweetened with splenda sucralose which i much prefer the variety packs like this one also appear to be a better price than if you order all one flavor yet another win ,1
my daughter cannot get enough of these delicious snacks and i have a pretty hard time telling her no since they are made of nothing but pure organic pureed fruits the packaging is fantastic to toss into your bag for on the go too all the flavors are great and if you want to try them before committing to a bulk amount starbucks now carries the line in store ,1
well they are crunchy except for the seeds that are so hard they do not crunch and maybe they are healthy but i do not find the taste attractive it is not bad for sticks and twigs but i prefer more flavor in this case more salt maybe some garlic to bring out the grain flavors these really remind me of some of the organic snacks in the is you eat them because they are good for you but you would really rather have something else i will stick to beanitos ,0
i first had this product from my mother in law who was from germany it is her favorite salad dressing then my kids love it too we used to get it from germany either sent to us by my mother in law or we would buy a year of supply when we visit germany we run out the dressing recently and could not get it because neither us or my mother in law are traveling to germany any time soon so my kids helped to search on amazon what a great surprise we ordered it right away and actually found this bulk package instead of the expensive individually packaged ones thank you amazon you can control how much and what kind of oil to add into your salad it makes any salad taste great ,1
aside from the phenomenal nutritional facts ingredients these bars taste great and the packaging is pretty darn sexy i purchased these as a meal supplement and instead of grabbing a snickers bar from the vending machine as most i t folks do i decided to take the healthy route i will be keeping these in my cubical overhead to carry me through the long off hours and most of all away from the vending machine goodbye snickers hello cocoa brownie ,1
teff in general is a delicious healthy grain and this teff is no different cook according to pkg directions and add to morning oatmeal for a hearty healthy breakfast if i had one wish it would be for it to be organic brown teff ,1

i have been using revolution teas for several years now an find them to be most consistent in producing a smooth not bitter taste the tea bags are great for a better flow and brewing i favor the english breakfast and earl grey teas while my husbands likes all of the greens we have never been disappointed with any of the revolution teas that we have had i carry a few in my purse to use when dining out why can not restaurants provide higher quality teas ,1
the oil itself is excellent and the lemon flavor is just right stronger than the stuff that you might get in a local grocer is at least here in texas but it does not have a processed chemical taste i find that using it as the only oil in a vinaigrette is too strong and so you need not go to the expense but if it comprises a fourth to a half of the oil and if the other oil is good the balance is quite nice in fact if the acid in the vinaigrette is a good sherry vinegar the flavor of the lemon in the oil is more noticeable than the vinegar ,1
my husband and i think this the best tasting coffee for coffeemakers at home buying from you is much easier sometimes the stores are out of this brand and then we are stuck buying other brands i think we have tried them all the flavor is just right customer service is great and the shipping is fast we love the fact that we can order the coffee from you and never running out after tasting this coffee we do not want any other brand ,1
i bought this for my wife to help her nurse i had high hopes for this product but it fell short in several areas first the taste of the tea is awful the fennel seeds are way too overpowering there is a reason that common teas do not include fennel as a flavor enhancer it has an overly strong and odd smell yogi has made no concession to balance out the flavor in fact it tastes like they just put fennel seeds in the tea bags which brings me to my next issue yogi is trying to achieve aqueous extraction with this tea aqueous extraction works well with leaves but does not work well with unground seeds seeds have extra natural protections which will not allow for the best extraction of nutrients using hot water alone this is why coffee beans need to be ground during preparation the fennel fenugreek anise seeds in the tea bags are simply broken up not ground with this product yogi has accomplished the equivalent of putting ungrounded coffee beans in a tea bag and calling it coffee the fennel fenugreek and anise in this product are not leaves they are seeds for it to work in any sort of effective way the seeds would have to be completely ground not just broken besides the poor execution in delivery of the nutrients i was concerned to see that the product had lavender in it which i do not think is all that safe for babies to be even indirectly ingesting i can give yogi credit for acknowledging the wonderful natural properties of fenugreek but i would advise buyers to take it through different means my wife uses,0
lakewood is pina colada is my absolute favorite juice it is utterly delicious and fresh so excited amazon sells it if you like pina colada in general you will love this organic healthy juice ,1
ordered this item as i am trying to eat more healthy was very skeptical at first coz of all the reviews on the taste but i thought that i would give it a shot i ordered the mango pomegranate infusion and was not disappointed it is green alright and looked like swamp water but it has a good flavor to it i mixed it with water to avoid extra calories the consistency is not too thick or grainy either i prefer this more than the other green stuff i had in the past i think that i will continue drinking it once a day from now on hopefully it will do what it claims or your healthupdate so today is my second day drinking this swamp water looking thing and i have to say that i like it even more it has a flavor but just a hint a note of fruit flavor in it which is why i like it is not heavily sweetened and not over powering if you are expecting a strong fruit flavor to cover up the green then look elsewhere for me i really like it one month i can feel that i am in a very healthy stage of my life not to mention that it makes me not want to drink alcohol which is good but i believe that it was the reason why my root canal healed in less than two days after surgery i had surgery on my front tooth treating my root canal monday afternoon and by tuesday night i was off pain jed is and munching on popcorn not to mention that i had no swelling at all what else can it be if not all the nutrients i am getting in addition if my food onus motion i have moved on to the chocolate flavor and mix it with almond milk and one banana it is it so good,1
it is definitely coffee with caffeine taste like vanilla mixed with coffee but not as strong as vanilla syrup or anything i honestly do not like this coffee which is personal taste the coffee is well ground and the smell of it brewing is very nice but not the taste of it ,0
i agree with the many other reviewers who have said that this tea is strong that is how i like it though compared to bigelow is peppermint this tea certainly offers more especially with the added menthol it feels like a breeze and rush in your mouth though there is no caffeine or added sugary ingredients i am quite pleased and i recommend this peppermint tea for a refreshing smoothing beverage ,1
the critics on my taste panel are hardened street dogs who usually eat anything yet they will turn up their noses at something if they do not like it they liked this these are rescue dogs and need fattening up fillers in a gourmet dog food will do nicely ,1
sodium phosphate is a preservative so these are not chemical and preservative free that is the part i read but i should have read more carefully i did not realize it was in there when i ordered these for my cats one cat ignores them but my other one loves them but sodium phosphate causes me terrible migraines so i stay away from it in my foods and medicines even a little bit has a bad effect on me this makes me very wary about giving it to my cat the salmon has no marinade and therefore no sodium phosphate so i will get that one again i wish the chicken was more pure i do not do many reviews but i thought i should point this out in case it makes a difference to anyone else i am always looking for healthy food for my cats and dog not sure this is with that chemical in it ,0

perhaps i did not read the description well enough on this item but it is a total disappointment for the price i fully expected it to be in the basket as shown i did not expect it to appear in a booby trap box as soon as i pulled the wrapped box out of the shipping container the bottom of it dropped out there is no basket or even a cardboard tray to contain the items the wrap on the gift box is designed so the lid will not come off ever that being said i was not very excited about the contents either i will not buy this item again nor will i bother with the art of appreciation line of gift baskets this review is for the ,0

i started drinking hint water a few years ago when smartwater discontinued its similar line of no calorie no artificial sweetners lightly flavored waters i find that i drink a lot more water during the day with these than with filtered water the taste is absolutely wonderful and refreshing just a tiny hint of flavoring no syrupy flavor like all the trendy fitness drinks out there and no carbonation or harmful artificial sweetners like with diet soda i was an absolute diet coke junkie for fifteen years until i found this product no hyperbole it is literally the only thing that i can keep in the fridge that will keep me away from diet coke it might seem a bit pricey but for my health i think it is worth every penny i just wish they would stock a larger size so i would not feel so bad about all of the discarded plastic bottles also this may seem a small point but i am a sculptor and thoughtful graphic design is very important to me i always get compliments when i hand these out to guests both on the flavor and the wonderful packaging my favorite flavors are the pear and the watermelon they are very subtle my husband is favorite is the honeydew hibiscus i like it too but it has a tiny sour floral tang to the taste overall i cannot recommend this product highly enough ,1
i ordered these because i was really craving them one day and they were here in about four days like a lot of reviewers before me said they do not taste exactly as i remember them but they are still really good and i would definitely recommend them ,1

i was not sure i would like any cereal that claimed to be double chocolate but i had a chocolate craving when i ordered it so i thought i would give it a try i can understand why it is called krave because after i tried one of the little chocolate pillows i was hooked i was kind enough to share with my family to see if it was equally appealing to children and teens including an exchange student from the netherlands who bought a box to take home to his brother since he claims they have no good cereal there it is very chocolaty the cereal comes in little pillow shapes with a light crunchy shell kind of like crispex and a somewhat softer middle that is also chocolate sort of reminds me of the filling in chocolate poptarts it is great to eat dry as a snack or in a bowl of milk as far as the nutritional part goes it is not too bad a serving size is of a cup and is calories with grams of fat it is of sugar but that is almost the amount of sugar you would find in smart start or raisin bran crunch so it is not too bad and tastes oh so good it does contain wheat soy and milk so keep that in mind if you are the allergic type this is one of those cereals that will be a treat in our house but also one that i will keep a box hidden somewhere for myself in case of an emergent chocolate craving ,1
this was a fun way to sample new flavors and revisit old favs when i saw how nicely it was packaged i realized i probably paid more than my regular kcup box but i wrote it off in the name of experimentation would have given it stars but they threw in decaf cups seriouslyy that was just annoying otherwise fun to have variety without committing to a big box ,1
the clear men scalp therapy anti dandruff shampoo is a good choice for dandruff control i normally use nizoral for my dandruff woes with excellent results but after using clear anti dandruff shampoo exclusively for days my dandruff has remained in check so it definitely works when i run out of my normal brand and have to switch to normal shampoo i will usually start to see flakes within days but that did not happen using this the shampoo itself is rather thick and leaves my hair feeling great spearmint and tea tree oil are listed in the ingredients both of which have very distinct and often overpowering scents but neither is particularly noticeable here every now and then i will think that i have caught a whiff of the mint or tea tree oil but in either case it is not noticeable if you are trying to find it the scent is fresh and not overly perfumed it does seem strong at first but it rinses away clean leaving your hair much more subtly scented one thing i will mention that i hope amazon improves is the packaging for this product it came wrapped in a plastic bag in a bubble mailer the top basically came open during shipment leaving a good bit of the product squeezed out into the bag a small seal just a bit of tape on the edge of the top would solve this issue that or shipping it in a box shipping this or any liquid product in a bubble mailer is a bad idea evidenced by the fact that the shampoo was wrapped in plastic overall i like this shampoo it is not going to replace nizoral but since i only use that a few days a week i can see this being a go to product in the interim it smells good leaves hair clean and soft and keeps the flakes away if you are reading this i am pretty sure that is what you are looking for ,1
aloe gloe is very refreshing i have not been drinking it long enough to notice the health beauty benefits it has a lightly sweet taste but by no means sugary the only complaint i have is the bottle if you drink it out of the bottle you get a weird plastic taste its actually quite strong so i pour it in a glass problem solved ,1

we have labradors both hunting dogs one yellow short a bit heavy the other black tall and lean they are both very good dogs and are house trained they both are able to sit shake lay down roll over and beg boy are they good at that last one i opened the back of bit o luv bistro beef recipe dog treats and both dogs were instantly very attentive to me sitting up nice and pretty and sweeping the floor with their tails then they tried the treat that looks just like beef jerky whoa you want me to shake can i roll over for you anything just give me another one they were a hit both dogs go crazy any time we go near that bag now they are used to getting treats at least once a day but this bag is a different color than the ones they are used to and they know it highly recommended for dog owners ,1
this cereal stays very crunchy in milk for a long time which is a huge plus for me tons of yummy fibers and comes with nutty flavor of flax seed and pumpkin seeds at amazon is price around it can not be beat i was worried that it might come stale or old but mine came perfectly fine expiration date was in will definitely use again ps it is organic ,1
i am a huge fan of rooibos tea and i drink at least three cups a day i was really looking forward to trying this rooibos blend with fruit and spices the first cup i tried was completely overwhelmed by the flavor of cloves i like cloves but not to the exclusion of everything else after the first cup i examined the remaining sachets each one had at least one whole clove and some had as many as five cloves which is cloverkill for one cup of tea not wanting to toss the remaining teabags i ended up opening the fabric sachets and removing the offending cloves and using the tea loose for me that was not a problem but if you do not have the gear for dealing with loose tea a strainer or a tea ball it might be a deal breaker with the cloves removed the tea was delightful the flavor of the rooibos was accented by a bit of apple and spice flavor that enhanced but did not overwhelm the flavor of the tea ,1
my son is allergic to regular milk and is on a gluten free diet but still needs to get protein calcium in his diet he loves taking the pacific natural foods almond milk cartons to school in his lunch box and you can not imagine how disappointed i was when the only store near us that carried it stopped this delivery service is great we set it up so that it arrives just as he is finishing the last pack right to the front door the other great part is the price per ends up being less than what we were paying at the local store ,1

this tea is loose so you need to have a strainer which i did not read in the description but i am sure it is there the tea is very fragrant i do not like mint but it is difficult to find rose lavender and camomile without mint mint does not sit well with me but the other ingredients do i like this tea very much it is very fragrant and potent beautiful box and very fresh,1

i love lindt chocolate the milk chocolate hazelnut and the milk chocolate truffles are some of the best chocolates i have eaten in my lifetime and i will be forever grateful that they exist however as i am no spring chicken the extra calories are not doing me any favors so i decided to go healthy by having little bits of dark chocolate at a time instead of gobbling down an entire milk choc hazelnut bar this dc black currant bar is delicious it is smooth not bitter and it has bits of sweet currants and crunchy almonds for texture the fruit taste is obvious but not overwhelming and i am happy with a square after supper to satisfy my sweet tooth definitely recommend ,1
i use to buy this stuff at the grocery store all the time to sprinkle on top of baked potatoes popcorn and steamed veggies in order to avoid having to use real butter and keep my calorie and sodium intake low if you follow weight watchers this stuff is a god send for flavoring food without having to tack on additional points ,1
when i received grove square coffee i was at first very happy about the price however it was before i tasted the coffee this is garbage for those of you who appreciate a cup of aroma and flavorful cup of coffee in the morning it would deliver you neither aroma nor flavor it is colored water to say the least exact flavor of diluted bitterly aftertaste instant coffee i would not recommend this product even to my worst enemy ,0
i was expecting the content would be more chunky and higher quality but it is mostly thin slices and gooey dark red matters my two cats do not take too much liking to it so i mix it with the more chunky type of cat food for them with the high price i think the food should come with better quality than this i will not order this again even though the food smells and looks fresher than regular canned cat food ,0
i purchased the hawaiian shaved ice snow cone syrups and so far have been delighted with them we have tried three flavors so far cherry root beer and tiger is blood the tiger is blood has so far been the favorite but all three are very good nice smooth flavors that are not weak at all and not over powering either much better than some of the others i have tried from the grocery stores everyone including the adults have enjoyed them and though i have made my own these are better and much less work my grandson who is recommends mixing flavors his particular favorite is the tiger is blood mixed with the root beer i highly recommend these syrups and am looking forward to enjoying the remaining flavors the syrups arrived very quickly and were very well packed no cracked or leaky bottles i will order these again ,1
i added a tiny bit of sugar once i stirred the packet into boiling water the ginger scent was divine and the subtle taste of honey was there too the drink went down easily but the ginger was a bit overwhelming and could be a little less spicy i would love to have had this drink when i was pregnant as it would probably help with morning sickness and it would also be great when you are nauseated or ill the kids tried it and the ginger taste was overwhelming to them so maybe adjust that in future blends i would buy it in addition to tea to keep on hand for the flu or when solids will not stay down i read that another reviewer added it to green tea and i tried it and it cut the spiciness of the ginger and made it smoother to drink ,1
if you care about your health than avoid this way too much sodium and fat ,0
you really can not go wrong with any of theo is chocolates but i am partial to this one i love dark chocolate and the texture that the almonds add is lovely to my palate this is much smoother than many of the other dark chocolates ,1
great value fast shipping these cherries are a great snack for my low sugar moments without being empty calories also great with hot cereal in the morning ,1
i am surprised that previous reviewers thought highly of the red vine taste my grandkids and i agreed that twizzlers have a much better taste and texture the red vines have a chemical aftertaste i am giving away the remaining packages of red vines ,0
i like the product very much but be aware that the best by date is february i may not have ordered it had i known the date but the price that i paid was very low compared to the current list price the current list price could reflect fresher product ,1
i first tried this candy at my gym i have been hooked on them ever since i like the taste and they give me a bit of a sugar boost for running on the treadmill there are many different flavours the only flavour i do not like is root beer everything else is pretty good ,1
my dog went through a lot of different food in her short years of life i tried nutro blue buffalo all organic fancy stuff that is sold only at this small id organic pet food place and i have to say this is her favorite it is bit pricey and apparently according to my friend eukanuba should be boycotted because they do experiment on animals i do not know if its true or not but this seem to make her the happiest also for some odd reason my cats they are very finicky when it comes to food starts to eat my dogs food for some reason the cats eat the the blue buffalo co blue wilderness but most of the time they are at the dogs bowl eating this stuff so go figure thought i would share since i have never seen this with my dog and cats weird thing is that dog use to steal nutro cat food from the cats but would not touch the blue buffalo stuff p s my dog looks like the border collie on this bag ,1
i am experience with loose leaf teas and tisanes and normally look down at teabags usually leaves get cut and damaged in bags but this is a really good herbal tea it is not too strong it is not bitter it is caffeine free and it tastes great now i want to have a cup because i am writing this review thinking about it ,1
a sugar free licorice with the real taste of licorice these are hard to find as are the jols forest berries i am happy to know amazon carries them ,1
this is a great tea to drink when you are suffering a sore throat due to post nasal drip it soothes without numbifying and leaves a protective coating to prevent further irritation the only drawback is the taste it has a very strong licorice and mediciney flavor but i guess that is to be expected best drinken plain it actually tastes worse with sugar ,1
nothing really to say about it except it is a great product and we use it every day plus amazon sells it at a good price ,1
i live in wisconsin and cajun food is hard to come by my grocery store carries one brand but it is not the least bit spicy they just do not understand heat up here in the cold frozen north gumbo just is not the same without good andouille so i found aidells and ordered a bunch it is so good we have it by itself on buns and my next order will be an assortment of sausage if they are all as good as the andouille i will be buying all my sausage from aidells from now on ,1
i had never tried hazelnut oil before receiving my order so i have nothing to compare it to but i have enjoyed this oil using it in salad dressings bread and baked desserts it has a very nice hazelnut aroma and a light flavor so far i have not noticed much of a distinct hazelnut flavor in the things i use it in but it does add something to the overall taste the oil came in what seemed decent packaging but each of the cans were dented not horribly just a few dings and a couple of bigger dents i wonder if perhaps they were damaged before shipping oh well so far my favorite use for this oil is a raspberry salad dressing mix the hazelnut oil with some raspberry vinegar and voila a yummy dressing also good in chocolate decadence ,1
simple review good flavor quick easy and appropriately sized for one person keeping the sauce separate makes the flavor of the pasta and the sauce come alive well done barilla ,1
bellino nougat candy was great tasting but not overly sweet a taste i would want to have again,1
keep a lid on these for two they tend to go a bit stale if they are exposed for a long period of time even the slightest exposure from a lid not secured tightly seems to compromise the are to die for when they are fresh yummy crisp and perfect with hot sauce or tabasco sauce ,1
i used this product under the belief that it was really better than regular flour guess what it is not go to the isle on your grocery store and you will see that there is about a carb calorie difference between this and regular wheat flour not to mention this is white refined highly processed taste delicious if you are on atkins or dukans and you eat this you may experience what i experienced my experience is what made me turn around and realize the truth about this insane cravings for more carbs you will want them whether it comes from this product or junk that is because a carb is a carb and regular store bought restaurant style vending machines cafeteria food etc will not use this product you will seriously slip in your will power the serving size for carbquick is only a cup you would do yourself a favor and just spend the money on a regular slice of acne golore i have minimal acne wheat makes me break out atkins gave me the clearest skin ever after a week of this product i had tiny zits all over my face unacceptable considering the expense of this product it is not worth paying for carbquick should be known as the carb that will quickly spike your insulin you would do better to get yourself some almond flour or if you are not wheat sensitive which most people are the fda just does not want to ruin the wheat industry just buy some real flour ,0
i discovered these morsels almost years ago and have loved them ever since back in the old days though there were more tentacles in the can which i really liked hence only stars there was more product in the can back then too but still i love the taste and texture of this snack and do not at all think that they are too chewy they are certainly not as chewy as the ika salad at the local sushi restaurants if you like smoked seafood and you like calamari i think you will really like roland smoked sliced octopus ,1
great taste solid flavor sparlking good thirst quencher that is a great substitute for soda ,1
not a really drinker do not keep booze in the house that said every once in a while i get in the mood for a libation always liked a long island iced tea but to make one requires buying a liquor store is worth of clears gave this a shot for like bucks in a big liter bottle totally on a whim when out to pick up a red wine for guests how awful could it be no worse than any of the other pre made cocktails which is to say horrible i have had figured if it was terrible i could mix it with real iced tea to kill the flavor gotta tellya not too shabby totally bested my low expectations especially at its bottom shelf price and cheap azz plastic bottle have certainly had worse out at places that apparently do not know how to make a proper long island iced tea put this in a tall iced filled glass with a lemon wedge good to go as always with recommendations ymmv but this will be purchased again ,1
although this is a little pricey it is well worth it for it does help me to relax and sleep and it is a healthy alternative instead of sleeping pills it claims to help your immune and digestive system i like it with a little honey milk cinnamon and nutmeg ,1
my vet wanted this supplement for both my dogs this is the same supplement at a good discount from my vet is price will be back again and again ,1
we have used these bags for a year now it is been great we line a tall white plastic can with it it sits open on the floor where people drop in coffee grind veggie and food scraps no raw meat used paper towels and napkins for some reason it does not smell i think it is because of the coffee grind paper towels and napkins mixing with the food scraps it also does not attract flies in five or six days this bag is usually full the night before garbage day we tie it up and put it in our green bin no fuss no mess ocassionally we would have to rinse the plastic can with a hose b c something fell in there for our purpose this bag never broke on us you should put most of your other waste boxes packaging materials cans bottles papers etc in your recycling can anyway for what little garbage is left we still rely on the white plastic liners one per week with the pink draw string until a good company comes up with sturdier affordable biodegradable bags ,1
table is inches in height it is heavy duty and rough around the edges and it had to be cleaned before use but it is beautiful i love the weight of it and the length and it is definitely commercial grade i intially was disappointed when i saw the product because it was so beat up on the underside and so dirty but once we put it together and flipped it over to stand upright i fell in love this item was very inexpensive compared to similar tables and well worth the price ,1
i must admit that i did not taste the cookies so they may have been fantastic however i purchased this item for a gift and when it arrived in a plain white pastry box sealed with saran wrap i was disappointed from the start when i peeked inside to see if the cookies were individually wrapped dry crumbs leaked out of the sides from the unwrapped cookies on the interior i will not purchase this product or any other from this seller again ,0
i order these products for my doxies and they love them do they want a treat yes and i am glad that amazon is quick to send out ,1
i have two doodles a brother and a sister and the male eats just about everything you put in front of him and many things you do not he seemed very interested in these and even the female took them into her jaws and scurried off alas we found most of them later secreted in different parts of the living room other plato treats have been enthusiastically recieved so i have a good opinion of the company worth a shot but not to the beasties tastes ,0
i found these in a local grocery store and was able to sample them before buying the whole family loves them husband myself even my year old i break them into smaller pieces for him we all love flavor esp spicy stuff so these hit the spot sorta pricey in store we paid over for one bag granted we never eat a bunch of them at one time usually after of them i am satisfied i love that they are peanut free ,1
the nuts i received were fresh tasting and the packaging was fine the inner cellophane seal is flimsy but the lid seals well although it is challenging to press all the air out due to the type of packaging used i plan to purchase this brand again ,1
mixing this product exactly as directed using boiling water yields a rather thin drink the balance of sweet to spice is good not too sweet and it foams up a good head as you stir for my preference there was too little coffee taste next time i will mix it with hot coffee instead of water others might prefer to use milk to make it a little richer allover a tasty product nice to have on hand for the holidays ,1
i normally buy these boxes for about each in nyc so this was great and it was shipped the very next day,1
i bought this for my son who travels often he is told me the thermos worked well the blooming teas were good for brews ,1
these are the best lemon cookies i have ever eaten they are refreshing to eat although they crumble easily my friends who are not gluten free agree if you love love love lemon then you will love these cookies ,1
i first tried these candies at a conference in washington dc and got hooked on them they are slightly sour and have an intense true flavor they are excellent for keeping your saliva flowing there are flavors in this mix lemon mandarin orange and another kind of orange that is close to blood orange these candies arrived a little sticky in their wrappers but it does not affect their flavor ,1
i loved mounds bars as a kid decades ago every few years now i succumb to my desire for one and always am disappointed i suspect that the recipe has changed to lots of ingredients and preservatives that were not used way back in my kid days anyway what i am getting to is that these oskri bars taste really similar to what i remember they are delicious and they are surprisingly satisfying although they are fairly small i like them a lot ,1
why is it so many products are getting hard to find in the stores as long as these have been around you would think they would be easy to find but more and more they are becoming seasonal well once again amazon to the rescue i now buy them in packs of because they go quick in this household and the awesome thing about them is since i have celiac disease this is one of the sweets i can have because they are gluten free i almost did a hand stand when i found that out because i have been eating these since childhood so needless to say i am one happy camper and hope i can continue buying these from amazon ,1
this is an awesome product love it very useful in detailing for cup cakes and cookies the price was just right for a set of order again when i need it ,1
i bought three climbing don juan roses by mail and one was doing ok but the other two refused to grow much i tried slow release rose fertilizer and nothing happened when i applied the miracle gro rose plant food there were new leaves in two days and in week each plant went from about inches high to inches they grew as much in week as they would grown the previous months this was truly amazing i tried it on other more mature roses and did not get any amazing improvement although theykept growing at a good rate ,1
the newman is own organics ranch style dog treats are pretty plain a brown rectangle the kids call them ugly compared to the other dog treats we have purchased at the supermarket but the real consumer of this product are the dogs and they love them we have two large mixed breeds and one is more finicky than the other think of them as the oscar and felix of the dog world and they both enjoy these treats though the treats are small for pound dogs the treats are sized for medium sized dogs you can always give bigger dogs two and the nice feature that i like is they come in a rectangle that has a line division down the middle that can be used to break the treat in half if you have a smaller dog so while they will not be winning any awards for attractiveness they are organic without unneeded additives and the dogs appreciate them as a reward for a job well done or just a treat for being the wonderful pets that they are ,1
this brings me back to the time i spent in europe better than any coffee at the supermarket for basically the same price a no brainer here folks ,1
i did not expect this cereal to be sweet it has the same chew as shredded wheat but is pleasantly sweet almost too sweet but not quite i counted the number of biscuits i put in my bowl and there were so i ended up with probably grams of protein not counting the milk and lots of fiber i was really happy to find another cereal for about calories for a reasonably sized bowl that i could enjoy in the mornings ,1
for the price you can get a much better tasting veggie broth powder seitenbacher vegetable broth rapunzel pure organic veggie broth higher salt content than seitenbacher but you need smaller amounts to acheive similar effect so it all balances out at the end also if you are cooking anything with mushrooms you want to keep the mushroom theme use,0
i forgot i order them they never came still waiting on them i tried email i got no answer so i gave up on it ,0
this product is not gluten free it has may contain wheat listed right on the top of the box along with in the ingredients list ,0
i loved these wintergreen altoid smalls so much i had to come write a review the packaging is small for convenience and the altoids are smaller as well with a square shape blue hue and even more delicious taste in my opinion i definitely prefer them over the regular size altoids and will continue purchasing them highly recommended ,1
these are an interesting product a delicious mixture of popcorn and chips they are chip shaped but popcorn flavored however they have a crunchiness more typical of chips the kettle corn flavor was very tasty however they apparently are not for everyone i bought them first for my daughter and she did not care for them but i found them quite flavorful and i liked the texture too ,1
this stuff is good tastes like pomegranate not too sweet great licorice texture chewy not waxy although pomegranate is not a particularly favorite flavor black is the best i would not hesitate to buy this at the store to top it all off it is organic ca not wait to try the other flavors ,1
these chips are really thick they are starchy and a bit dry they taste ok but i will not be tying them again ,0
rich tea biscuits are really not the most exciting or glamorous biscuits in the world if exciting and glamorous are even words that can be applied to biscuits at all but they have one purpose in their un glamorous existence and that purpose is to stay together when dunked in very hot tea with milk of course and to taste thoroughly delicious when devoured in that wobbly floppy milky tea sodden state basically when you need a rich tea you need a rich tea and there is no other biscuit that is cookie to most of you i suppose that will suffice and when you need a rich tea if it is not made by mcvitie is you really might as well forget about it these are the dull drab boring un chocolate covered un sexy shy wallflowers of the biscuit tin but dip em in a nice hot mug of english breakfast and they are just incomparably if un glamorously delicious i am lucky in that i have a whole stash of the things my mother brought me over from the uk on her most recent visit but that stash is dwindling already and i am very happy indeed that i can stock up via amazon rather than having to wait until the next parental visit hmmm this might just mean i can stop rationing the things out like it is or something and just munch my way merrily through half the pack with my cup of tea like i would back home ,1
this is a very low carb and tasty snack that will fit into almost any diet but be ward this item contains msg if you have an allergy,1
flax seeds are good for you but adding them to my diet like anything is really a matter of convenience these flax packs are so convenient and portion controlled in a really sturdy little packet i keep a packet in my purse and it really gets tossed around so far watch i just jinxed myself no premature openings in my bag the flax seeds are always fresh i add them when i am away from home to cold cereal and oatmeal for added nutrition ,1
 asin cottie is a little cat approximately pounds of love i buy bags of food so he gets a balance of those foods he refuses to eat in canned form with the smaller size i also keep him from being bored with his diet which i understand can be a problem for cats the larger bags are more economical but they would hang around for too long and he would tire of eating what is in them this is the latest newbie they are all kept together in one of these huge storage bins with a top that secures very well to the bottom keeping food fresh and bugs out i have taken to writing a note for each bag stating the dates he was fed and what went in bowl there is no bowl for those of you old enough to recall daytime tv of old the only other thing i could add to this recommendation would be if i were to observe him eating it and make yet another note of the date he finished the portion and do the same for a couple of other foods for comparison purposes ,1
this is one of the most delicious gluten free cereals i have tried and i have tried many it is a really tasty crispy treat it does not go soggy in soymilk right away and it holds up nicely if you enjoy a gluten free version of rice krispy treats mmmmm ,1
we discovered this finishing sauce when a friend of ours from st louis prepared dinner for us and used tuckers on the steaks it is a fantastic finishing sauce providing a very robust flavor with all the appropriate seasonings welove it our friends love it thumbs up we usually buy bottles every time we are in st louis at dierbergs and when not in st louis amazon is the solution ,1
another birthday means another order for fortune cookies from greenfire this has become an annual tradition in our family our son picks a theme and the experts at greenfire come up with awesome looking fortunes to give to his friends i have also used the cookies as gifts for colleagues as well as clients and they think they not only look cool but they are yummy too i love the fact that we get to be creative and different at a reasonable price perhaps even better than the actual cookies the staff at greenfire always accommodating and easy to work with i am not just a customer i am a part of the team ,1
i purchased this thinking i would get an assortment of several k cups to try i had varieties but with the name sampler pack i assumed there would only be of each kind so i could sample several kinds to decide what i like not just test the same flavor times each packaging was a brown paper bag taped shut and placed in a box with bubble wrap some of the cups are a little dented not impressed overall if i could return it i would and i will not order from this company again ,0
i bought extra of these since my dad wont eat any other sausage made his birthday thanks so much ,1
one of the things that i love about my keurig is that i can have coffees teas and hot chocolates on hand for my guests even though i would not drink them myself i prefer coffee favored coffee such as the newman is own organic dark roast and timothy is rain forest espresso this item is a good example of the joy of beverage diversity although it is too sweet for me i am pretty sure that children and young adults will like it i think that it is great that some people are blending their k cup brews very creative when i use my machine at the smallest setting and mix timothy is white chocolate with my newman is own it becomes something entirely different i will keep this on hand and offer it to my guests who prefer to drink their desserts ,1
i should say i loved it when i bought it a while ago but never looked so close at it my wife showed me a few very small bugs floating on the water in the rice cooker not going to send them back since i did used some of it and not worth the try hope that it was in a batch of it and the manufacturer can read and figure out this not going to buy it again ,0
if you have had millstone chocolate velvet before youalready know how good it is this was just as good asthe bigger bags though i would get the bigger bag next time forconvenience smooth excellent chocolate smell nice finish highly recommended ,1
nutiva organic hemp protein powder is consistently excellent i have been using it daily for about nine months now in a morning breakfast smoothie with other organic nutritional products recommended by my doctor one of which is the ultimate meal the results are highly satisfying hemp powder is an excellent source of protein from one of the most nutritious sources known it blends well with fresh or frozen berries and fruits but usually i prefer a whole fresh organic avocado in the smoothie for added protein and energy that satisfies and keeps me going for hours and on occasion instead use organic fresh or frozen berries or fruit for variety i recommend nutiva hemp powder for anyone interested in achieving and maintaining superior health it always arrives very well packaged in superb condition my best suggestion is that anyone interested try it and see for yourself personally i would not want to be without it one of the services amazon com provides that i use for this product is subscribe and save because shipments can be scheduled and changed or suspended easily as one chooses ,1
we have cats a little over year old we started out feeding them blue buffalo but they were always very gassy and of the cats were getting plump while another was too skinny so we ventured into trying other brands healthy or otherwise they can be a bit picky but they eventually got used to anything their favorite was the purina stuff but that is just like us loving junk food is not it while the skinny one did attain a normal weight the plump ones became quite fat so eventually we picked up this goodlife brand for indoor cats they took to it well and before we knew it the fat cats are down to a healthy weight the skinny cat is looking a little skinnier too but she has maintained a healthy weight with this stuff it is been about months now and they are all still very healthy and i am very happy with this brand and this particular recipe indoor it has been a perfect balance for all of our cats we did try the all ages a couple of times but it does not seem to satisfy them as well and they eat a lot more of it ,1
tully is italian roast is a full bodied cup of coffee without bitterness great with dessert or after dinner good flavor at mid size cup or next size up too weak at the largest cup size now if we just get the price down a bit ,1
after having tried numerous gluten free chocolate chip cookies these are by far the best the dough is kinda dry and crumbly but after cooking they are moist ,1
when blended teas became available a few years ago i jumped to try as many as i could the fun wore off when most of the blends i tried were too unbalanced or too simple for the ingredients to really get synergy i then went for blends only as medicinal support this cucumber white blend really scared me vegetables and white tea but i tried it on the insistence of a friend i was floored by how round and full of flavor this blend is this tea manages to come across as calmly invigorating and robustly refreshing the cucumber is a subtle fresh note atop the more earthy white tea base i can taste the tiniest hint of lime too all in all it is a playful grown up blend that gives just enough caffeine to perk me up it is low enough in caffeine that i can drink it a couple hours after my morning coffee and it does not make me feel caffeinated at all i think this would be a great iced tea too if i had a spa salon wellness center i would serve this tea even if the idea of cucumber white tea puts you off try it i think you will be as surprised as i was ,1
i received the zym berry sports tablets in a timely manner and started using them right away the tablets are more convienent than powder mixes the zym berry is berry licious ,1
my teenagers love this bar the bars are chewy and sweet and satisfy their need for chocolate we always keep them in the house ,1
we used to give our dog pig ears which she loved the problem was that they added weight and did not clean her teeth we changed to the ct hextra premium chews on the advice of our vet greta loves these chews and her breath and teeth are clean and fresh smelling ,1
though i do not need to eat gluten free foods i know people who do and can remember a time when there were less choices and those on a gluten free diet had to settle those days are long gone nature is path crunchy vanilla sunrise is gluten free organic free of synthetic pesticides and herbicides free of irradiation and even is packed in an enviro box and the list of good stuff goes on and one but what about the taste my first impression is that it is overly sweet sure to be a hit with kids as i finished off the box i got more used to the sweetness and it became less obtrusive sprinkling a handful of unsweetened blueberries on top of my bowl of cereal actually hit the spot quite nicely the cereal is pleasantly crunchy and its variety of shapes and textures and cereal types adds some visual interest also as i reach the bottom of the box i ponder whether i would buy a new replacement box since the taste of this crunchy vanilla sunrise is more ok than outstanding i would probably only buy it if it could be had for a outstanding sale price ,1
i used to buy chips ahoy brand cookies at the store once in a while because they were my favorite cookie from childhood it had been years since i even tried a keebler brand cookie and one day i found them on sale i found that keebler chips deluxe originals are thicker fresher more crumbly although very few if any were broken in the package and overall much more melt in your mouth delicious than chips ahoy originals which were thinner a little harder and almost a bit stale tasting if i remember correctly the chips deluxe cookies package has ounces more in it i have never been a fan of the soft batch ,1
the flavor and quality cannot compare to zevia ginger ale made with erythritol and stevia but not into a mega commercial commodity i do not know all of what they must do to process truvia into what it is since they do not have to disclose the process or the additives but no comparison to just good erythritol and stevia would not have thought it would make such a difference we will never buy any of these sodas again all of the zevia sodas are good although more expensive they are worth it and do not make everyone have serious intestinal pain ,0
love this stuff exotic and new got a recipe to make a stuffing with it stuffed a steak first then a chicken breast then tried stuffing a chicken breast and covering top of entire breast almost like breading the top wow black garlic stuffed and breaded chicken breast was off the hook drooling now just thinking about it i highly recommend this product while a little pricey you get what you pay for nice treat for garlic fans like myself ,1
i can not speak for other states but i can tell you that in the state of north carolina texas pete is an institution it can be found in practically every non fast food restaurant ranging from barbecue spots to your local waffle house as well as about of homes here it is a pretty versatile hot sauce i think it excels on pizza and is made for scrambled eggs it has one pitfall though it has practically no punch and is widely considered a starter hotsauce for this very reason for those of us that like our hotsauces to have some firepower that is a bit of a problem since we like the taste but the lack of fireworks texas pete provides usually forces us to mosey on over to something a little hotter so it was with great surprise i saw that one of the local supermarkets had this on thier shelves i was not expecting texas pete hotter hot sauce to be much hotter than it is predecessor but i was very wrong this stuff is plenty hot and has the same basic taste as the regular variety i brought a bottle to work where a number of my coworkers are hotsauce afficianados and after a few tentative splashes onto their foods of choice they all began devouring it so fast i had to bring in a replacement bottle weeks later if i had to guess i would say that this stuff rates at least scovilles or so it is brought some fun back into breakfast ,1
i have a german shepherd and a american bull mix i decided to switch from taste of the wild dog food to this blue buffalo weight management my american bulldog mix was getting overweight and i wanted to help her shed a few pounds using this food since the totw is pretty high in fat the countless positive reviews on petsmart and mostly good on amazon had me sold i really wish i had tried a different food now i noticed both dogs stool was a little soft when i was gradually changing them over which i did not think much of once i completely switched them over it was probably the first night i was awoken to one of my dogs having terrible diarrhea on my carpet which is a lovely aroma to wake up to she also threw up a couple times that day and the next as well so i took her to the vet and everything was normal the vet gave her some meds just in case it was a stomach bug the next day my shepherd starting having the same terrible diarrhea and went in the house the food is the only thing that has changed with my dogs so i really have no doubt it is what has caused all of the problems i am going to discontinue using this food immediately and probably go back to the totw i would use this food with caution ,0
for those of us who do not wish to pay for a cup of cofee at a coffee bar and only want a good cup of coffee the filter packs make it fast easy and convienent ,1

unfortunately i had the same issue as the previous customer on august i received a product that had expired in june,0
boy i really loved this drink it tastes much like orange soda only with no oddball aftertaste it is plenty sweet but the sweetening is so naturally orangey that it does not seem overpowering like a coke can it is much smoother and easier to swallow than a conventional soda with carbonation that is plenty strong but not quite as strong as a can of crush it is a drink that is subtle not only in tone but in flavor you can taste the various other fruits mixed in with the tangerine and orange but it is still very much an orange drink with no fruit punch aspirations it tastes perfect and there is no doubt that someone carefully went crazy saying notoo much not enough to every little facet of the drink before it was just right no corn syrup or other bad additives at carbs per ounce serving it is still got quite a lot of sugar in it if you are looking for an orange soda style drink that is really just carbonated juice this is the best possible product i am quite sure ,1
i enjoyed this pomegranate flavored licorice i usually prefer the black licorice and this was a pleasant change i really like newman is product and so i was not surprised when i tasted it and like the consistency flavor it is a nice little treat not too sweet and fun to chew ,1

the dry product is extremely fine almost powdery the cooked product is mushy and does not even taste like grits to me i like the coarse stone ground grits which have not been de germed regular white grits from the grocery store is preferable to this product i will donate the three unopened boxes to our local food bank ,0
i have been using evanger is whitefish sweet potato for my old cavalier kc spaniel she is got terrible ibd and has to eat the limited ingredient dog foods i had been buying the prescription id from my vet and it was fine but it was not always convenient to get to the vet is when i needed the food on the strength of advice from a woman who had dogs with various stomach issues none of her dogs was a pure breed so it is not just for expensive overbred dogs like mine i tried it for my dog and we have not gone back to the prescription brand yes it is more expensive than grocery store dog food but it is a little less expensive than the vet prescribed food and i have saved in further vet and medication costs b c her stomach is not churned up by other brands it is well worth the cost get a small bag to start and go from there ,1
i bought this for our christmas dinner big mistake what we received was a very small and extremely overpriced turkey stuffed with little pieces of what may have been duck and or chicken and a lot of nasty tasting stuffing the proportions were nothing like what is pictured unfortunately due to the nature of the product frozen stuffed and the time it is traditionally served thanksgiving and christmas dinner you do not find out it is crap until it comes out of the oven and by then you are stuck with it because most of the stores are already closed despite the small amount of meat it easily fed seven people with ample left overs mainly because nobody finished what was on their plates let alone went back for seconds on a positive note our dog loved the stuff and happily ate everything that was dumped into her bowl ,0
i drink tea everyday and was excited to find such a great deal on this tea regrettably the only good part about this tea was the price the tea tastes somewhat bitter and earthy and not in a good way and is weak also i will not buy this again and will stick to pg tips or yorkshire gold ,0
i do not eat doughnuts not worth the fat and calories so i decided to try this this is a win win for me tastes like a chocolate glazed doughnut this is my dessert coffee my only complaint is i wish all k cups online were clearly stated decaf i like this coffee enough that when i got it and read on the box that it is decaf i knew i would adjust when i drank it but not in the morning i never intentionaly buy decaf coffee but i have it very much enjoy it and will order this again ,1
i have looked everywhere online for the original tvp that i used to buy from adm is country store in decatur il in these folks i finally found it they are courteous very friendly and are just good people they ship quickly and package in ways that make sense ie i bought they shipped in bags instead of one bag i will not be buying from anyone else and i use a lot of this product as i am primarily vegetarian if i could give it stars i would ,1
the small can in which the olive oil is stored are very handy and does perserve the fresh flavor of this very good oil the qualityof this oil is high enough to use it as a dipping sauce especially when mixed with fresh herbs ,1
these cups are not worth the minor convenience they provide the hot chocolate tastes like plastic i can only assume it is a result of hot water hitting the plastic of the cup maybe the coffee ones do not give off this foul taste because of the filter inside i do not know i can not even finish using the cups in the intended way rather i have taken to peeling off the foil dumping the mix into my mug and running a cycle of just water through the keurig nearly as simple without the nasty taste i will not be buying these again i will stick to using the normal packets and running aforementioned cycle of just water do not waste your money ,0
i have tried several tassimo t discs and the gevalia is the best coffee i have ever tasted i am a coffee snob and love this coffee ,1

just water and large pieces of sardines open for all types of combinations of which i find the old whole grain crackers quality cheese a particle of mayo and mustard and a hot cup of tea the most appealing they do lunch in a hurry and snack times as well solid product even drank the water in which they are laid to rest and not too shabby sardines are good for a person everyone agrees on that even a sardine sandwich sounds about right in the next few minutes the better the bread the better the sandwich so yes solid stars and i am hungry for the product right now come to think of it ,1
i am another dr oz viewer who saw him rave about rice bran oil on his show so after doing some additional research i ordered it to see how well it actually works and tastes after using the rbo three different ways it is definitely a hit and my whole family loves it the first way i used the oil was to substitute it for vegetable oil when making a raspberry vinaigrette the second way was to make fried potatoes with green peppers and onions and the third way was to use it making cupcakes the vinaigrette was light and delicious the potatoes were also light and delicious without that greasy quality that sometimes comes when too much oil is absorbed into them and the cupcakes were very moist not too dense and they too were delicious really the only difference that we noticed was positive and consistent the oil has a light quality that takes on the flavors of the food instead of the food tasting oily and heavy another benefit is that rice bran oil cooks very well at high temperatures after trying this oil using different cooking techniques i highly recommend it to others ,1
one of the things i appreciated about this product is no sorbitol included all of the sweetness comes from natural sources including brown sugar and sugar the grains are all whole grain and include a broad spectrum of vitamins the size of the individual squares is smaller than one typically gets with a shredded wheat product and they maintained their crispiness much longer the sodium content is reasonably low at mg and the dietary fiber is respectable at grams as is the protein at grams the taste is pleasant and that along with the sustained crispiness makes for a nice change from shredded wheat and raisin bran this one is worth a try ,1
i live in po dunk wy where there are not too many gluten free cereals and this happens to be one of them good choice actually it has a very good flavor and does not get soggy its a bit unnerving buying this as an adult but it works for me i also use almond unsweetened vanilla flavored milk on it and enjoy every bite i do agree with it being too expensive with shipping our grocery store has it in the organic space so look for it ,1
 that without swedish pancakes life is scarcely worth living when i fix breakfast i make pancakes from scratch but i always make sure to have a box or two of lund is mix in the pantry in case my wife or a visitor has the urge to cook lund is mix needs a half teaspoon or more of cardamon and of course these pancakes must be served with lingon i use a special swedish flat pan to make perfectly round pancakes but that is just a picky extravagance an ordinary iron griddle will do fine i have found that the mix does not fry well at altitudes above feet i do not know why otherwise the results are plenty good and this is a bargain price for twelve boxes var s god och ta nog ,1
i really enjoyed my waffles made from this mix the apples had a nice texture soft and not crunchy the taste of the cinnamon was just right not overpowering nor wimpy i am glad i bought this flavor mix ,1
i have been using this for my dog for just about a year now for the first years of his life he had regular bouts of the poops even though he was getting a premium kibble he used to pick at his food it took him hours to finish his bowl he loves dr harveys and has not had a loose stool since on this food i will never use anything else ,1
i was so thrilled with the chebe pizza dough and breads i bought that i had dreams that the chebe cinnamon roll mix would be the same but they did not turn out they where not airy like the other breads and like every other gluten free cinnamon roll i have tried the sugar rolled into the middle just cooks the dough to quick sad ,0
i purchased cartons of instant breakfast through amazon in march they were priced a third of what they are currently too bad it was convenient to order from amazon for this but apparently buy locally is the only option i can afford ,0
amazon has a hell of a nerve charging for a case of happy bellies cereal when anywhere else it is each can ,1
if you want true organic pesticide free then you will need to look elsewhere the title and description as of today are deceiving this product is not organic it is only made with some organic ingredients if you read the ingredients the strawberries are not organic however the title and description lead one to believe the product is organic strawberries are at the top of the list of pesticide containing fruits and it is a shame that a company that prints on their cereal boxes since erewhon has led the organic revolution and we remain passionately committed to providing the purest organic foods would cheap out and put non organic strawberries in their cereal if you do not care about eating organic then enjoy the taste is okay i only tried a couple of flakes and they had a slight odd flavor but i cannot comment on the strawberries flavor as i could not bring myself to eat non organic strawberries my husband said the cereal tasted okay but natures path corn flakes and mesa sunrise flakes are much better ,0
i toast these seeds very lightly before i bake the bread the taste is really good and i sprinkle them on salads too i like the fact that they are packaged in glass jars ,1
another hit from coffee masters not overly oily like some flavored coffee companies make but still the same flavor again a pretty good sale for bags of beans does not make as good an iced cup but more than makes up for it with a normal brew smooth creamy but not overpowering works out to of coffee for still a good deal for flavored coffee ,1
the timothy is white hot chocolate tasted good to me it is a good alternative to coffee or tea i did not think it tasted like weak sugar water at all which was the feedback left from several reviews i had no resediue issues or need for stirring but this may be because i have a newer model keurig no complaints here there must have been some changes to this product over the past few years because i ordered the product read the reviews and was worried i would wasted our money when i saw all of the negative comments but that was not the case the only drawback is that is costs me weight watcher points so i will have to drink sparingly i am giving it four stars because of the stiff competition from chai latte and cafe mocha that cafe escape k cups offers these two items are staples in my kitchen that my husband literally frowns upon when we run low or out of ,1
not returnable this product is misleading there are only boxes total that comes to for boxes or for a single glass so this is very misleading because this is not package of but of the rice dream packs not only that this item is not returnable that is right i cannot get a refund even if i am not satisfied with the product or something wrong with it i will have to contact the customer service directly and test amazon is service buyers must be careful about buying products from party merchants they do not have the great return policy that amazon does i think that this really degrades my experience with amazon i will be much more weary of buy anything more from amazon in the future especially since it is difficult to distinguish those items sold by amazon and those sold by third party merchants even more important it is difficult to know the return policy on an item until you try to return it updatei emailed amazon and they notified me that this product is indeed sold by amazon and that groceries with expiration dates are not returnable however they refunded my money because the product did not meet my expectations and told me to disposed of it as i wished thanks for the free rice dream amazon hope you change the description on this item as you have done with the other listings of rice dream ,0
x cans of pumpkin for are you kidding no one in their right mind would pay that much the nextag link shows it as libby is pure pumpkin cans pack of but when clicking on the link to get to the amazon page it shows it as cans they can keep it ,0
i like these best of the kind bars because they do not have any fruit in them they can sometimes be hard to bite but a few seconds in the microwave helps soften them up ,1
i love grove square spiced apple cider cups single serve cup for keurig k cup brewers i am not a coffee drinker like my husband and wanted to try something more than just hot chocolate with his keurig i thought i would try the spiced apple and love it the bonus to this product is that it is sugar free i highly recommend this winter or summer ,1
i really loved the taste of these cookies they tasted like they were home baked instead of manufactured like most store bought or packaged cookies they seemed more nutritional than normal packaged cookies i used to not like oat meal cookies but this may have changed my mind i would definitely buy these again ,1
i love these microwavable curry noodle dishes they are quick easy and naturally gluten free i love the spiciness and tenderness of the noodles when cooked correctly my only criticism is that i wish the portions were slightly larger and it is impossible to boil the noodles in the microwave without having the water spill over overall a tasty product ,1
this is the highest quality of coconut oil on the market and the price can not be beat coconut oil is a high heat oil so it will not burn your food like lower heat oils use freely for sauteing frying and anywhere the coconut flavor is a plus it is not overwhelming in flavor just subtle i have used it to deep fry battered fish and yum so tasty also use it to make popcorn your popcorn will not burn and you will get a really nice flavor and of course you can use it on your skin hair etc there are many benefits to coconut oil ,1

the cherry pie larabar is delicious and is a great healthy snack there are no additives just fruit nuts there are lots of other flavors too if you eat one of these bars and have a cup of yogurt with it you have got a healthy meal the larabars are gluten free dairy free soy free non gmo vegan and kosher they are not only healthy but they taste good too ,1
eaten cold this no sugar added cereal has a crunchy texture and a pleasantly sweet subtle flavor like a more sophisticated twist on grape nuts but it is when this cereal is served hot that it really shines in addition to packing far more flavor than oatmeal it also has the perfect consistency for cooking somehow it never seems to stick to the bottom of the pot and it takes just a few minutes every person i have ever served this to has been impressed this is the most delicious oatmeal i have ever tasted they say there is no need for any sweetener though raisins and sliced banana are always a welcome addition chopped walnuts are also great for adding protein and some extra crunch i like all of ezekiel is cereal varieties about equally well and would pick any of them over any other kind of cereal and amazon is prices beat those at my local grocery store it is a great way to stock up on a truly amazing breakfast food ,1
this is a bag item i was shorted one bag emailed amazon about this and no response what so ever better check on your customers emails or this could end a wonderful relationship not happy with amazon llc when they send orders and do not fill the right amount ,1
at mg of salt a pop that seems awfully high to me that is about one tenth of the salt you need in a day ,0
i have been into brown rice for the last few years for the health benefits i got a little bored and tried this brown and wild rice blend it is probable the tastiest rice i have ever had it has a sort of nutty flavor and aroma that plain rice can not match just looking at it on the plate compared to plain rice it looks so much more impressive i use a rice cooker and when it is cooking it smells so good in my pressurized cooker it seems to require less water thani am used to but with some fine tuning i made it perfectly i always wash it first to avoid it being sticky i can not imagine going back to plain rice any time soon i had company over and could not wait to see their reaction to this rice they loved the smell and the taste i had to share one of my bags with them i will definitely reorder before my last bag is done ,1

rip mr shelby you made awesome cars i could never afford but your chili kinda made up for that seriously this chili mix is very hard to screw up the directions are very consise and clear and it just tastes great i like the fact that all of the spices and flour are kept in separate packest allowing you to make the chili exactly the way you like it personally i like a thicker chili which is flaming hot so i end up using everything in the package as well as adding a minced habanero and chunks of beef if you add a bit of tomato paste before anything else you will end up with a very flavorful chili you just need a tablespoon anyway i have been buying this for twenty years and i have never had a bad batch ever ,1
first pill pockets are a great product that really works before pill pockets i only had a success rate getting our three dogs to take their pills when we used hotdogs and even steak leftovers with pill pockets the pill always goes down note don t waste your money buying pill pockets for cats if you have dogs i read a review listed under another seller that stated that it was more economical to buy the pillpockets for cats because you receive instead of well the reviewer failed to notice that the pill pockets for cats only weighs ounces and the pill pockets small bag for dogs weighs ounces buy the bag that per ounce is the least money the pill pockets are like beef playdoh and are easy to tear in half we tear each one in half and wrap around the dog is medication do a little research and you will save money btw the multi bag deals online at amazon are not necessarily a good deal be sure to divide the total cost by the number of bags you receive to see if you are saving note the size listed on the pill pocket is bag indicates the size of the pill pocket not the dog large meds require larger pill pockets small meds like phenobarbital require only the small or a piece of a large pill pocket these things are great and go down my dogs easily ,1
i was so disappointed with the flavor or lack thereof that i threw out the remaining pieces i only tried a few but i just could not love it the cinnamon flavor was not strong at all and after a few minutes i felt like i was just chewing rubber i like gum to give me a fresher feel and this did not help at all i will never order again no matter the price my order was a complete waste of money ,0
we have given our bulldog iam is for most of his years over the last year he has lost a significant amount of weight and had grown several bald spots knowing the normal life expectancy of a bulldog we had assumed the inevitable was upon us however my wife saw the reviews for this food and we decided to give it a try the results are amazing he put on weight returning to his normal size and his coat looks better than it has in years the bald spots have regrown hair over the past two months and the overall sheen is great we could not be more happy to have found this fountain of youth food atticus even feels up to visiting parks and playing with other dogs after a couple days of adjustments even the flatulence seems to have improved this product easily gets five stars despite the cost we are a royal canin family from now on ,1
i have always used this brand of canned salmon it is very nice to be able to get it through subscribe and save good price ,1

there were no cooking directions included i put cups of rice in cups of water let it boil for minutes then drained in a strainer it came out fluffy and was not sticky at all the only reason i gave it stars instead of is even after cooking the burlap smell from the bag the rice comes in is still distinct it does go away after a few minutes and there is no after taste to the rice my family loves the rice and it cooks up faster than other brands ,1
i would prefer to have a bit stronger coffee but overall i am a regular customer of this german chocolate cake coffee i do not think you will be disappointed a hint of coconut with chocolate not a hot chocolate drink it is coffee with the flavors i recommend it ,1

look at the ingredients it is made with black tea google black tea and fluoride and you will see that black tea is loaded with fluoride because it is made with the oldest part of the tea plant it contains the highest level of fluoride of any tea fluoride is not healthy for anyone if you want a healthy natural tea get one that is made with white tea leaves white tea leaves still have all the beneficial antioxidant properties but much much much less fluoride than either black or green teas ,0
i love this tea tried it initially at a friend is home and instantly loved it this tea is delicious it is not a boring raspberry tea the flavor is much more complex even with me trying to conserve it i have been averaging a week my friends and i jokingly refer to it as raspberry crack tea i especially love that this tea tastes great both hot and iced some teas just do not taste right both ways ,1

i bought this to make my own pepper cream for the wifes arthritis not to consume rub on affected areas knees back elbows etc i used pure cap in a mixture of baby oil oz of baby oil to be exact shake well and use where needed for pain relief rubbing only a small amount of this provides instant pain relief and lasts for hours you can decrease the amount of purecap to your liking in our case we wanted strong and long lasting no worries about that hours later you could still feel the burn the arthritis pain was totally gone we used so little of the mixture that the oz of baby oil is going to last months no more drugs no more drug expense no more drug side effects this is a god send but be real careful do not get mixture in your eyes or open wounds you will be bad shape if you do always wash your hands in cold water and have lemon juice ready afterwards to remove residue from your hands or treated areas i am sure this product is great in cooking however since we do not eat peppers i have no idea long live natural remedies ,1

these arrived in good time with no packaging mis haps great tasting apricots and no sulphur dioxide yeah i should have ordered several more packages ,1
barry is irish tea gold blend the red box is an absolute star must try for the serious tea drinker as a traditional continental tea it is much stronger and better than the black teas typically available to us here in the states one tea bag of barry is is much heavier and aromatic than what you are probably used to you can make two strong cups from a single bag pickwick finest english is my hands down favorite but barry is gold blend is a close second and a must have essential to my stock of tea if you are looking for a fine heavy tea to get you started in the morning or to share a cozy sunday morning with give this traditional tea a try barry is is a nice alternative to morning coffee try it the english way with cream and sugar ,1
this is a great strong flavored coffee without bitterness it keeps well in the thermos too enjoy,1
we used to buy this at sam is club but they stopped carrying it we tried other brands but never liked anything else as well then we found out you could order direct from the company and we did that for a while but it was expensive now i found it on amazon at a much better price than buying it direct from the company so we are happy ,1
i do not do canned beans as i prefer my beans without bpa plus it is just so much cheaper to cook them myself i cook a pound at a time and freeze in portions which is pretty close to a can in recipes cannellini became my favorite legume as soon as i tasted them i can not find dried cannellini beans in any of the groceries around here so this is darned handy so getting them in bulk from amazon works well for me ,1
i was sceptical about these but my sister brought me home a pack from germany fake banana is not one of my favorite flavors in fact i have to pick out the banana pieces from runts or it makes me gag still i tried one of these the first was decent the second was good and before i knew it i was halfway through the bag it is not really a banana flavor per se more tangy fruit with just a hint of banana delightful actually and the texture is great just chewy enough but also with a tad bit of crunch like the circus peanuts but better enjoy ,1

yes many search for a substitute for dessaux fils vinegar out of business for years once julia childs only vinegar with a perfectly aged and balanced flavor and virtually zero vinegar edge the roland review that recommends their aged red wine vinegar as a substitute for dessaux fils is off the mark the roland is fine but at acidity it is closer to the italian style and much too harsh the closest we have found is dutour red wine vinegar aged in wood at it is almost as smooth and balances at dessaux fils ,1
this is a beautiful plant it comes already potted in a sturdy heavy blue green glazed rectangular pot i added a bonsai figurine for a very attractive scene it comes with outdoor instructions but it can grow indoors too just put it in a sunny window and keep it watered now the picture shows flowers there were no flowers on the plant i received but it may bloom later in the year we will see i figure it will just be a green leafy bonsai most of the year i am satisfied with it and would recommend it ,1

i bought packages of these peppers though there were some brown ones most of them were in good shape and ready to grind up into a fine seasoning while it was not as hot as i expected it to be it was as hot as they were described hotter than i can eat on their own at least for now one good thing about the ghost pepper is it does not just have an intense heat but has a really intense kind of smokey flavor that really makes it a yummy pepper if you can handle it it goes good in chilli if you are used to spicy foods i would not use more than a quarter pepper a serving though ,1
very authentic tasted just like the beans they put in my favourite chinese takeaway keep them in a glass jar with a tight fitting lid to make them last properly to use the black beans just take out what you need and put in a sieve and hold under cold running water to get rid of the excess salt then put the beans in a bowl of cold water for to soften i like to use these beans with chinese flat wide rice noodles if you go onto google images and type in whatever chinese recipe you want a load should come up just click on the one you want then press the x button on right hand corner of the picture if anyone is after chinese flat wide rice noodles then a good place to go is quite near walthamstow central station as you enter walthamstow market you will see a shop on the right you will need to stay on the left hand side walk for minutes and you will come across a chinese shop not particularly big but they do have a lot of stuff and they sell the noodles fresh and dried as well as an abundance of other chinese goodies for your recipes as well as a selection of frozen dim sum mmmmm apparently you can freeze the fresh noodles then defrost when ready to use if you can not separate them properly then pour boiling water over them for the dried noodles cheaper you will need to pour boiling water over them for,1

nutri grain bars say in big letters that they use natural ingredients and in small letters that they use chemical dyes and other unnecessary offensive ingredients that cause tongue lesions and other undesirable side effects also there is a tiny kd logo on the package front suggesting that nutri grain is kosher dairy which any person who cares about kosher foods would recognize as an insult at best and a downright fraudulent use of kosher logos at worst ,0
that is all i can say delicious and convenient so nice i am going to say it twice delicious and convenient ,1

our dog loves this brand of dog food but normally eats a different variation of purina she does have trouble with food sometimes because her stomach is sensitive but i still wanted to give this brand a shot so we got this bag and mixed a little of the old version in with this one when we gave it to her it has been about two weeks now and she is doing just fine and loves the food we are happy that we have found another version of purina that she can eat so we can mix it up a little for her ,1
my dogs love these i have a lb golden retriever that will eat anything i give her she operates on blind trust and if it comes from my hand it must be good so of course she eats these happily but hey she drinks from the toilet so how picky can her palate be on the other hand i have a lb tibetan spaniel that covets ownership of any and everything that has been dropped on the floor or has been offered to the golden however he does not wolf it down instead he carries off any treasure he finds to his pillow where he will carefully delicately and privately decide if he actually wants it if he does not she can have it after he is done inspecting it he is very picky about what he eats and generally turns his nose up at most treats after carting it away for the inspection ritual mind you he does not really want it he just does not want her to have it however even this picky little critter enjoys these and gobbles them up so while not having tasted them myself i can honestly say most dogs will enjoy them thoroughly on a medicinal point i have not found any improvement to the golden is bad breath after using these this is no substitute for brushing ,1
this is the second teechino flavor i have tried and so far its my favorite it does not taste like a coffee substitute it is a fabulous tasting beverage in its own right it has a very rich peppermint mocha flavor which blends really well with their base ingredients the first teechino flavor i tried was the vanilla nut which was good but this flavor is much much better i brewed it in a starbucks barista cone coffee maker i served it with a teaspoon of sugar and a splash of vanilla soy creamer organic valley yum i am using teechino to get off coffee and so far its working i am down to tbsp of coffee in the morning and i drink the teechino by itself in the afternoon ,1
these taste just as good as triscuits in my opinion i have not found them to be overly salty i buy these as a cheaper alternative if you want to know the source of any of the ingredients you should ask the company soy is a natural ingredient i am not sure what the star review is about ,1
i have been buying dried peaches all the time through sahara my local store has increased the price this year and i started looking on amazon found this one and ordered it took almost a month to arrive and smells terrible i am pretty sure that the manufacturer used sulfur dioxide to process the peaches and left this stinky smell i was in a hurry to travel to eu for a month right after i received the peaches and was not able to file a return do not buy if you care about your health the product description does not include using this chemical for processing i gave one start because i could not give lower ,0
i like this blackberry pomegranate iced green tea almost as much as i liked the mango pineapple it is also full of flavor very sweet and has only calories and of caffeine per ounce serving ingredients honey granules sugar honey citric acid provides tartness green tea powder hibiscus extract sucralose sweetner maltodextrin corn natural flavor blackberry juice solids isomalt soy lecithin pomegranate juice solids simply delicious and i appreciate that it is low in sugar and carbs ,1
i have been trying to lose weight for months but have only taken this for a couple of weeks over about the last months i have lost pounds but i had plateaued since i started taking this product about weeks ago i have lost about pounds i am watching my diet and working out i had been working out regularly for a long time already and watching my diet admittedly on and off for quite a while before this week period so while this product alone i do not think has caused weight loss for me i think it has given me a boost and helped get me off a plateau no stimulants the b vitamins are good and glucomannan fiber helps with both fullness and ahem certain functions i like it i will keep taking it ,1
all of the regular drink mixes contain sucralose aka splenda and other artificial sweeteners it gives them an aftertaste i would expect from a diet soda not to mention health concerns and they advertise no high fructose corn syrup like its healthier ,0
excellent quality follow package directions for al dente and the doneness results in a pasta very different from regular pasta quick delivery able to order in quantities more consistent with a home than a commercial restaurant we ordered six packages and that will be enough for us for a couple of months ,1
as someone else mentioned the taste is somewhat reminiscent of the peanut butter girl scout sandwich cookies as a college student i just throw some of these in my backpack and when hunger strikes these are ready at hand i like them because they do not make me feel sick after eating a bunch of them like potato chips do also because they are whole grain they supply good long lasting energy i ordered the variety pack first but found myself wishing the cinnamon and honey ones were peanut butter needless to say i was very happy when this peanut butter only pack went on sale you can have your variety i will take my peanut butter ,1
this is a bit more costly than other candy but amazon offers the best price along with fsss the first time you try it it will be a new experience the candy is like a hybrid of gum and starburst they are highly addictive and i locked them away so i would not eat them all in one day best for special occasions like going to the movies or would make a great small gift with a gift card in my opinion in the end it is about quality they are just awesome and do not have an extreme sugar taste like starburst they are basically imported too from taiwan product originated in japan so that also adds to the value give them a try i am probably going to try melon next ,1
i wanted to like it since it is so much healthier than most alternatives but the taste just is not there my daughter and i both immediately said the same thing after tasting it while it is indeed spicy i e hot it is also sweet which sort of deadens the spiciness of the flavor we wish that we had not ordered two boxes of this but had tried a different flavor instead perhaps we will but it is somewhat disconcerting to consider that we might also not like the taste of the different flavor since the cost of the product is not inexpensive thus we are not yet sure that we will order more ,0
we purchased this product to re fill our gumball machine and were generally disappointed by how hard the gum was and how short lived the flavor was compared to other refill products we had purchased in the past although we liked the price at the time in retrospect the purchase did not represent a good value ,0
i can not decide if these crisps are better than plain old potato chips but i do know they are much better nutritionally i have got them on a subscribe and save order plan you just can not eat a couple of them wish they would come out with some more flavor choices these are really great ,1
these may be the best candy ever delicious and could not eat them fast enough ca not find these in stores near me so it was great to find them on amazon and worth the wait ,1
the box no longer says made with real land o lakes butter and evidently it no longer is the taste is off evidently diamond foods present owner of pop secret general mills would not have made such a foolish decision has no taste for quality this used to be the a premier pop corn now its just a kernel of what it once was ,0
i have these on auto order we go thru them so much my daughter and her husband came for the holidays and he does not really eat sweets but he really just about ate a whole bag himself i first ate gummi bears way back in the is when the german club sold them when they got them from germany along with toblerone and these taste alot like them the german gummi bears taste a bit different than the american gummy bears i prefer these to gummy bears yummmm,1
i been enjoying this sauce for years i love it and put it on everything,1
with the possible exception of their fire roasted chipotle salsa i can not really taste a significant difference this is the best salsa out there in my opinion there are plenty that are less costly and that alone may guide one is choice in another direction but if cost is no object this is the real deal ,1
i was looking for an organic mac n cheese that my kids would like and this is it not only is it organic but it has the whole grains that i wanted make sure to mix the cheese packet with organic milk in a separate bowl before adding to drained noodles to avoid clumps i tried to skip this step by adding it directly to the noodles in the pot and ended up with lots of clumps price is better here on amazon verses our local store that carries it ,1
i originally started buying zevia a year ago for my diabetic mother we actually did some glucose testing just after drinking a can and our glucose levels did not change so that was good to know the flavors are good especially dr zevia i recently was able to but the new flavors in chicago cream grape and mountain zevia the grape was the best recently i switched our entire office to zevia since i always felt bad buying sugared or chemicaled drinks for the company at first a couple people were reluctant but now everyone is hooked ,1
i am not a big popcorn eater my daughter and wife are but this is just like the movie popcorn and cheaper ,1
i signed up for this product to auto ship to me periodically with the proviso that i could cancel at any time i have cancelled and the product continues to ship to me how do i get it to stop ,0
i have tried allot of different k cups from several providers and the barista prima colombia coffee is the best that i have found i highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates good bold coffee ,1
some people debate about the high ph one can google to find the issues and discussion i used to drink trinity water but they went out of business i found essentia and found i like it better i only drink bottled water essentia is expensive so i use other spring water for making coffee and cooking but i drink a minimum of four oz glasses a day often six the recommendation of glasses of water per day has now been found to be excessive four to six will do but it definitely makes a difference doing so my skin becomes smoother and clear within days it helps when i work out i now get it through amazon through subscribe and save it is cheaper than in the stores even in whole foods with a case discount and it is too much of a hassle to ensure the stores have it as they are quite inconsistent with their water ordering the taste i find delicious and superb my partner prefers glaceaus smart water he drinks it at room temperature and it has a lower but still substantial ph in researching for this review i have learned about two other waters with high ph is kagen and qure there are differences among all three and i have not had the time to nail down the differences and which would be deemed more healthy i probably will do that sometime in the future but you can not go wrong with essentia try some chilled in the fridge and see if you like it your body certainly will ,1
these soups extreme sodium content makes me pause each time i order them i like having an easy snack on hand for the kids as these taste great are fun with the various different mushrooms and are filling and easy to make the sodium just makes me cringe but this particular flavor almost redeems itself with the very low fat content ,1
this has to be the worse espresso coffee i ever tried if you think it is good you have never been to a starbiucks to try their express ,0
great product when you need just a little extra stock broth it will not replace my use of swanson is because it would be too much to open packages for quarts of stock for soup etc but it is great for making pilaf etc or when you are just a little short of the quantity needed ,1
learning to bake without gluten is a new process for me i thought that working with the dough seemed more like making a cookie dough than rolling out a pie crust without gluten it lacks the elasticity that i am used to once i got the knack of working with the dough and doing some patching i was very pleased with the results the flavor and appearance of the pie were not distinguishable from a crust made with wheat flour in fact the crust was flaky and even better than many pie crusts that i have eaten ,1
i like red vine it is good snack for movie and video game and i ate the whole thing and well didnt get fat off of it ,1
my son loves to eat these in his lunch he also uses them to dip with his applesauce these are great healty snacks better order cartons because you will eat them quickly ,1
purchased this for my wife and she loves it we brew most of our herbal teas from fresh or home grown herbs however with this mix of herbs it is easier to purchase than to mix the instructions for use leave allot to be desired and differ from how we learned to brew herbal teas so we just alter them to suit our experience the smell and color helps me believe that the herbs are fresher than most prepackaged teas ,1
i was hesitant about buying cookies online however they were shipped very fast they were the cutest little cookies for celebrating they tasted fresh and did not last very long i would buy again ,1
just a note to tell everyone that the lb variety comes in boxes not bags i have used these since i got my two french bulldogs years they love them and they are very healthy because of them this according to my vet walmart stopped carrying them so i went over to amazon where i do most of my buying anyway i am never let down by amazon good luck with these biscuits your dogs will love them and stay healthy while eating them ,1
i picked up a jar of this recently at the store to make green curry chicken at home and was very disappointed in the level of spiciness i used a full of the container along with a can of coconut milk and the other ingredients listed on the recipe on the jar fish sauce a little brown sugar etc even with that amount the dish was barely flavorful let alone spicy my husband who really does not much care for spicy food said it was underwhelming so overall it was really disappointing the sauce did turn out smooth and creamy but if it is a good spicy green curry you are after i would try another brand ,0
this is a great treat but i tasted no difference between tim tam and the american version from peppridge farm so i would stick with the american version to save money ,1
great flour its packaged individually and makes it nice to store the bread i have made with it tasted great very happy with this flour ,1
the links were delicious ordered several different kinds and liked them all the price is a little steep but worth it and probably will order more in the next holiday season ,1
this flax seed is great on cereal in the morning i also use some of this product in making an aromatherapy eye pillow mixed with lavender ,1
love the product very disappointed that it is not available to be ordered i have been trying to order this product for months and it is always out of stock emailed the manufacturer but did not get a response ,1
i tried madagascar vanilla red by celestial which also contains rooibos so i thought i would give this a try due to the great reviews first impression tea is way too sweet and can not wrap my mind around what ingredient causes this sweet taste if you like your tea very sweet and concentrated then this is the one for you after trying both teas hands down madagascar vanilla red is way tastier ,0
i can not say enough good things about these k cups delicious a way for me to enjoy tea lemonade one cup at a time so i do not waste it and i like being able to order a large amount at one time i can not find them like this at sam is club like i can the coffee ,1
one side effect of rheumatoid arthritis is a dry mouth a dry mouth is uncomfortable distracting and can lead to very bad breath and even tooth decay and mouth infections this gum is a very easy way to get some juice flowing the tart taste is not overpowering chewing a piece of quench gum is an easy fix ,1
this is by far the best rice i ever served to my family i am not able to find it in the supermarket so i order it on line i just cook it and serve withbutter melted on it the best ,1
i am a bit picky about the coffee i drink and found this camano island coffee roasters to be top notch i have not tried the light roast but the medium roast was very nice with an earthy aroma and just the right amount of boldness to it without going overboard also i read the one star review posted and have to say we experienced none of the bottom of the pot after three hours problem with our delivery in fact we are ordering another pounds edit this review is for the whole bean coffee rather than ground same brand and roast ,1
enjoying a cup of coffee or two a day i was really disappointed when acid reflux reared its head and coffee was off my list i enjoy coffee alot i enjoy the whole process the ritual i was glad to find this coffee but really was not that hopeful it turned out to be a nice smooth mellow coffee that my stomach tolerates this is not to say i can drink alot of it but for a nice hot cup of coffee it definately does the trick ,1
i love this tea the peach and the lemon but the problem with this site is that i have been getting it from the big lot stores michigan for why is your so much higher ,1
you must try this take one segment dunk in your coffee a few seconds then let the molten chocolate delight your mouth or take a small bit and keep it in your mouth while sipping i have even made a hot chocolate with it by melting a few slices in milk unbelievable ,1
these gave me a headache too much sugar and other ingredients that did not sit well i would not recommend to someone trying to eat healthier ,0
the dogs love these chews and i do not have to worry about them swallowing too big a bit as they break down well ,1
i love jasmine rice and usually buy it pounds at a time at the local asian market but i thought i would try this well i really was surprised at this rice i have never seen such large rice grains puff up in my life they were like super size rice grains that being said i think i prefer others this reminded me too much of regular old long grain rice but the best price in a pinch if you need it ,1
as a kid this ice cream was a favorite treat i have been told it has the highest milk fat content of any ice cream around and man can you taste it this stuff is amazing if you are a fan of premium ice cream this is the best stuff ,1
seafood ramen i love having these sodium msg packed instant noodles every once in awhile when i am too lazy to make lunch or dinner i do not know if you would actually call these seafood flavored though there are little dried fish cakes and plenty of seaweed in them but they are somehow indescribably good i actually like the original flavor better but since these were cheaper i went with it i have seen these with cheaper prices at asian supermarkets when it is on sale but if you subscribe to this on amazon it is worth an extra dollar or two not to make a trip to the market when i cook these i usually add an egg some veggies and leftover meat or whatever is in the fridge the seafood flavor packet is strong so it adds lots of flavor to everything else when i got these delivered none of my ramen were crushed so it really depends on how carefully your delivery company treats the boxes anyway i would suggest buying one packet at a store first to try it before committing to a whole box ,1
i got this for our pound puppy and he played with and enjoyed this bone for a good week it took him quite a while to whittle it down it stopped him from eating shoes and pillows ,1
i liked it a lot not too sweet and very fruity i liked being able to have it available for a refreshing drink where ever i might be i would recommend it ,1
we had bought a donut pan baker about a year ago and never used it because well just because i found this mix at homegoods for so amazon is price is a little steep easy to make just add an egg butter and milk i used the tub of land o lakes butter canola blend they look very pretty and are just right for a special day like christmas morning ,1
lindor extra dark truffles are among the most amazing food in the world rich creamy goodness that is simply amazing and amazon is prices are as good as i have seen however be careful when you purchase these via mail order if the weather or the shipper is warehouse or the delivery vehicle gets too warm you will have mis shapen messy truffles they still taste good but if you are ordering these for gifts or otherwise need them to look good i recommend you shop locally where you can check them out firsthand and you have more control of environmental conditions ,1
i sent this as a gift to someone in los angeles she really liked it but it eventually died it was pretty finicky but the one year she had it the blooms were very nice it is supposed to be good for her zone but she is not a great gardener or anything i am just saying if you are not a good gardener it might not live ,1
i recieved this bear yesterday and it is truly amazing how big it is if you are looking for a great gift to make someone laugh this is the perfect gift its awesome ,1
i purchased the cherry berry and orchard blend snacks for my and year old girls they love them they are perfect snacks for children all natural no sugar added grown in the u s the orchard blend is slightly easier to eat the pieces of fruit are larger and the cherry berry is a little messier but both flavors are a big hit i highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a delicious and healthy snack i will definitely keep ordering these items ,1
this creamer is not found in stores here in sc it must be wholesale only product do not know why because it is delicious by far the best chocolate creamer you will buy ,1
omg you have to try this tea i bought it because i read on a website that hibiscus tea would reduce your blood pressure whether that is true or not i do not know i have not used it long enough to tell but whether it works for the blood pressure or not this is a wonderful tea it has a beautiful color and great aroma and it is very flavorful even with out adding a sweetner i would recommend it highly the fact that it is organic and fairtrade just adds value to me ,1
the grape and the peach both come through ok but there is a hint of something else that i can not quite identify it is not unpleasant though not quite consistent with the grape and peach flavor that is supposed to be dominant looking at the label it is likely the pear juice that is blended in though i will not have any problem drinking the full case that we purchased it is probably not a flavor combination i would personally want to try again i like a slightly stronger taste and this is a bit subtle to me it may well be just what someone else wants however i do think it deserves four stars since it is above average and beats some store labeled brands hands down ,1
big banner on the front of the box whole grain ingredients enriched flour whole grain blend what a ripoff i wrote to old london and they did not even answer they have an entire line of crackers that use this sneaky dishonest packaging ,0
as someone who likes organic products and gingersnaps i was intrigued by this product first off let me point out that these are not your mother is gingersnap cookies they are very clearly something that came from a factory and were mass produced and when i first tried them after opening the bag they were very tough to chew pretty dry i would have a drink with them especially since they were a lot spicier than other gingersnap cookies i have had they do however keep very well despite not being loaded with preservatives just roll up the bag and they will stay good for several days at least after which point i actually found them more enjoyable as they would softened slightly all in all not the greatest store bought cookie i have ever had but if you are into organic products and like gingersnaps these are definitely worth giving a try ,1
this is a great variety nuts and fruit go very well in the oatmeal the packets seem a slight bit smaller than others but it is very delicious and i will defiantly order this variety again ,1
love this tea and it is a great amount for the money makes a nice pot of tea to enjoy ,1
i love this product i wanted something healthy and good tasting that did not have added sugar or chemical sweeteners as an alternate to water this is it i like this coconut water better than others i have tried it is not as sweet as the amy brian brand which i prefer i do not use sugar so i found this brand to be the best the taste has also been consistent since starting my use of this in april i have purchased four cases since june it also has a lot of health benefits ,1
this is the only cat food i buy my cats range in age from to and they all eat this the sensitive stomach formula is xlnt in reducing the number of nothrow ups that i used to experience with other foods i am a loyal customer and will not feed any other dry cat food ,1
i try and follow a low carb diet and i love ketchup this is a perfect product for me heinz one carb ketchup tastes to me the same as heinz regular ketchup i just wish it was widely available in local stores sure the small size of the bottle makes this a spendy proposition but then it really is the only way to go for that real ketchup taste i adjust by using less ketchup than i would have in the past and purchase it in bulk to minimize shipping costs i have been drawing down a case for nearly a year now and have a few bottles left like all ketchup it stores well i wholeheartedly recommend this for anyone who wants needs to eat low carb and desires to continue using ketchup as a condiment ,1
whether you like this candy or not depends a lot on why you are buying it if you are older like me and looking for the red licorice that was once sold in department store candy counters and candy stores by the bunch in the sixties and seventies then you will be disappointed this is not even remotely similar to that candy until eight years ago our mall candy store sold the original red licorice laces but they replaced it with the kind that tastes like twizzlers in the form of a string i have been looking to no avail for the original variety ever since this order was my last hope and it seems the kind many of us grew up with simply is not being made anymore personally i did not really care for the taste but that means nothing since i was looking for the kind they use to sell and this was not it if anyone does know who sells the original type i wish they would tell me ,0
second german made coffee product we have tried this one was just as good as the first best decaf that we have tried highly recommend jacobs kronung decaf pricing from amazon was the best we could find on the internet and delivery was quick ,1
i am an expat from the uk and have been in the us for years i felt a much needed trip down memory lane was in order this easter and snapped up the old uk christmas staple quality street giant tin of sweetie goodness now if you know the quality street brand then you are good to go as this big two pound octagonal tin has all the favorites but if you are unfamiliar with these amagic moments then you are in for a real treat there is lots of various chocolate and caramel toffee candies wrapped in bright multi colored shiny foil with each one from the strawberry delight to the big toffee penny a taste sensation and in my humble opinion far surpasses the treats you can get in the us take a trip down quality street you will not regret it ,1
i finally decided to give the wild hare beef jerky a try since it kept popping up on my add on options whenever i ordered my k cups my family loves jerky and so i thought it would be a good idea to try something besides the grocery store favorites for a change size the oz package came with jerky pieces not strips and its apparently a grand champion recipe winner from wisconsin so i figured we were in for a treat texture this is a thinly sliced jerky robust and chewy gives your teeth something to work onflavor peppery i love pepper so this was a nice surprise over the saltier versions we have tried in the past there is a slight smoky flavor to it but does not overwhelm the beefinessprice i bought the oz for which seems like a good value and the smaller size gave me the opportunity to try the teriyaki and hot cajun i will definitely order this again and might try the beef sticks too ,1
imagine my suprise when i went to prepare the product time buyer and there was no spice packette so i needed to open all the remainng to check if theirs were missing found another even so i would recommend this product it is not quick but the rice turns out fluffy and flavorful by no means is it spicy intend to add my own on the occasion that i would like a little more heat as for the boxes sans the spice mixture i used them in a fresh tomato soup i had made yummy next time will include the spices it was that good when the weather warms i am thinking to transform it into a cold rice salad so i would definately recommend this product if you need to be gluten free or not ,1
my girls love these i can not get my year old to eat fruit but she happily will suck down a pouch i got the big bird strawberry banana ones and they did not like those as much just wish these were cheaper ,1

my dog goes crazy for these bunny bits i let two bits roll on the tile floor and he chases after them before eating them he is critter driven so anytime i can make something fun he is for it i highly recommend this product my local pet shop discontinued these treats i was so happy when i found them here online at amazon will be buying more when we run low these are small enough in size to use it as a training treat ,1
these were perfect for my red velvet cupcakes with cream cheese frosting for a dig pink volleyball game everyone loved them and they softened into a frosting consistency after sprinking them on the previous night loved them ,1
even though these beans seemed fresh they had terrible flavor they were way worse than the average navy bean from the bulk bins of my local health food stores after cooking one batch i ended up throwing the rest in the garbage i have been frustrated by the uneven quality of beans from my local health food stores sometimes great sometimes terrible often the beans are very old even though the stores i shop from are busy and have high turnover of beans so i have been on a mission to find a mail order source of consistently great beans for navy beans these are not it or at least this batch was not it note i did like eden foods kidney beans so i am not criticizing the brand ,0
i love this cereal i was getting bored with oatmeal and i wanted to add different grains to my diet bob is red mill rolled hot cereal let me add variety to my breakfast with awesome flavor it cooks just like oatmeal too so easy for the morning ,1
my dogs loves this treat and all the treats by barkery they are made in the usa what more could you ask for great service from amazon ,1
i had no idea this water was black i thought it was just the packaging and as i was driving had no idea until i looked down shocked to see that the plastic bottle was indeed transparent so completely unbiased i thought that the water tasted just like another alkaline water alka pure which is in the same price bracket i have no idea as to the veracity of claims fulvic minerals are good for you or not but the taste of this water and the cool fact that it is indeed black put it at the top of my list for expensive bottled water no idea what people are talking about that the taste is isalty or weird it obviously has a slightly metallic taste because of the mineral content which i vastly prefer over the calcium softness or chorine tinged waters available by tap or cheap mass production hope that common sense will prevail over the overwhelmingly negative reviews this product seems to get if people can look past the black which i think is its chief selling point then i think consumers will ultimately champion this water ,1
i have brewed my way through a bag of this stuff now and it is good coffee not bitter good mouthfeel nice color and of course smells great while it is brewing pretty much worthy of the starbucks label no vanilla though maybe a little hint while brewing maybe that is just because i was hoping to smell it ,1
i am not a real coffee drinker but i do like this one the package arrived on time and since tj is does not carry it anymore i was happy to receive it very pleased have returned multiple times and bought this item repeatedly ,1
if you are looking for a good pasta alternative this one is great if you are looking for a mac cheese replacement keep looking we are celiacs who have caesin intollerance so our taste have changed over the years this is a very healthy yummy alternative for those living a minimally processed lifestyle it does not have a cheese taste we ate it mixed with broccoli my year old and his little buddy had child sized helpings they have not had much grain recently and demolished everything on their plates i added the little bit leftover to my evening salad for a different texture was still very tasty ,1
i have not tried an extra bold coffee that i did not like having said that i find the coffee peoples black tiger extra bold to be very good i normally drink this product after dinner the name is a little intimidating but overall a goood cup of coffee i like strong fresh coffee however i find my guest like something milder than bold coffee ,1
best popcorn salt wo not buy any other brand or kind every one who eats our popcorn rave on how good it taste all because of the salt ,1
slightly sweet and perfectly strong it is stronger than the chai lattes you can buy at starbucks probably because it is powder and not liquid to me it tastes like what you get if you order chai latte at an indian restaurant and add a sugar or two ,1
this tastes horrible i am fairly sure someone a kikkoman just blended their expired sauces into this horrible concoction this stuff seriously has this odd chemical aftertaste that almost reminds me of curry ,0
ordered this item from all the great reveiws only reason i gave it four stars is becasue will not know how it tastes unless an earthquake comes along and need it as a food supply i will be able to taste it then if not it will become a time capsule food for someone to find ,1

my wife has celiac dz not me this is the only gf stuff i can stand i actually prefer it to regular pancakes we also use it for other stuff too it is pricey especially vs regular flour but with amazon and the off for regular shipments it is a little more affordable do not forget trader joes pasta the cheapest and the best ,1
this is a great package and an easy way to get three surprisingly different orange bitters if you are really getting into cocktails as i am you will quickly realize that a large number of cocktail recipes from the is and earlier require orange bitters just substituting angostura is okay in a pinch but you will really be missing out on the subtle flavors that true orange bitters add to the drink depending on where you live some of these may be hard to find i can not find the fee brothers or regan is at any of my local stores and these two are both well worth trying satan is whiskers for example is a heck of a cocktail but try it with regan is wow also a plug for the folks selling the product at kegworks i made a mistake when i placed my order on amazon and the guys at kegworks were able to fix it and redirect the shipment to get it delivered in time excellent personal service ,1
so this cereal is amazing i bought it not being sure what it was like and i am not disappointed deliciously vanilla ry this is a cereal good enough to eat out of the box obviously it does not score highly for health benefits but with a name like cookie crisp who is surprised ,1
i was looking for a new type of mustard other than the standard tastes i have been used to this however was a venture i should not have made it turned out to be the most unpalatable harsh tasting its indescribable the only thing i can assume is its not made for eating directly but to be put in some type of cooking process i washed it down the sink and kept the jar at least got something out the deal ,0
my yorkies are picky so finding something they will eat is a good thing i have to slice it up for the pounder it is to soon to tell if the product works but getting them to eat it is half the battle i can see the tooth paste froth so i will keep my fingers crossed ,1
love this tea i start off each morning with a hot cup of pu erh and then have another cup with breakfast all it needs is a packet of spenda but i also brew it with a sprig of fresh mint delicious ,1
my dog got really sick from eating this product vomiting for days and had to take him to emergency room there have been documented cases of illness and death from chicken jerky products search for articles on this issue i can not believe this has not been recalled i am glad i caught it before he got really sick but there have been many documented cases of death now i do not want to see any more dogs get sick or die from these products ,0
i have cats one is now years old i started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in the lack of grains and real meat not the processed kind you find in the grocery store is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore while there are some veggies the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product i supplement with one serving from,1
these bars are the most delicious breakfast bars that i have tasted once i eat one in the morning i am good to go until lunch i would highly recommend these as part of a meal or simly a snack ,1
i received this package in the high heat temp and the company did not take any steps to protect the quality of the product i attempted to taste the product even when i was concerned due to how hot the product was upon arrival the almod butter was bad the temp has been around in the st louis area and the company did not request any special shipping to protect the quality of the product the temp with the box in the heat had to be even higher baking in the mailbox i found out after the product arrived in bad shape that a return was not even an option bad business i would never due business this way ,0
i would never had beef rendang but i have love most curries so i gave it a shot the instructions on the package say to buy of filet mignon however a little web searching revealed that beef rendang normally uses slow cooked cheaper cuts of meat and the prima taste website has instructions for how to prepare the curry that way basically just use half of the sauce and seasoning initially and add the rest near the end plus use more water anyway the end result using chopped up beef round and pouring the curry on top of bhutanese red rice was spectacular so why stars instead of i could not find any good options even on the prima taste website for adding veggies the meal is the beef equivalent of a death by chocolate dessert but if you are looking for a delicious and different curry this stuff gets it done ,1
i love that not only are these organic but the lining is also bpa free they taste great on their own in dishes or on top of chips as nachos i keep them on hand in my pantry for a go to item when i need to feed my family something fast can still feel good about what i am feeding them love these ,1
now i have eaten a lot of pistachios in my years these are the biggest ones i have ever seen excellent quality very few unopened nuts and they are perfectly salted an open bag is an empty bag at my house highly recommended i am glad amazon sells this brand ,1
i really need to cut down on my sodium intake because i have very high blood pressure i have been a salt fanatic for many years i put salt on almost everything so i am a very harsh critic when it comes to salt substitutes i recently ordered and received a similar no salt substitute blend from another website and it has absolutely no salt taste i have tried a few others as well that also tasted nothing like salt so i really did not have high hopes for table tasty i figured i would order it anyway based on the positive reviews and it was shipped very fast i can honestly say i was pleasantly surprised when i tasted this product i thought for sure it would only taste like a sodium free spice blend like all the rest but it actually has a salty taste when you try it right out of the bottle the taste and smell actually reminds me a lot of those flavor packets that come with ramen noodles or the cup a soup packets in a box which are both loaded with sodium it is hard to believe i have no idea how they have achieved this since there is no sodium at all in the product all i know is i will now be ordering a large bag ,1
when i lived in wisconsin i was a big fan of this choc after moving overseas i sent emails to the company asking about how to get it or even act as exporter for it but answer came there none to borrow a lewis carroll phrase such a pity ,1
i love the taste of this honey it tastes vivid flavorful and absolutely delicious i did not know what i was missing out on until i tried comb honey the packaging came with four squares of honeycomb each wrapped in its own transparent plastic case all were taped and sealed to prevent the leakage of honey and then bagged once more it is a bit messy but i think the packaging is still pretty good i heard you can freeze up honeycomb and thaw it later ,1
throughout the work day i usually drink about ounces of water just sitting at the desk the past couple months i have been trying a variety of different energy drinks and supplements when i had the opportunity to try the vitamin squeeze fruit punch energy drink through amazon is vine program i decided to give it a try i am drinking a lot of water every day anyway so i figured i might as well try to mix things up a little the drink itself comes in a container that looks a little like one of those newer upside down ketchup squeeze bottles there is supposed to be enough product for servings this water additive concoction contains vitamins c as well as magnesium and chromium it is also supposed to contain of caffeine about the same as a can of regular soda i liked the overall design of the bottle it is aesthetically pleasing and the bottle is quite easy to use once it is opened it also does seem to provide a very short burst of energy after use however i had several issues with the product the first issue i had with vitamin squeeze fruit punch energy drink is that it is a bit more difficult to open in addition to removing the wrapping from around the edge you have to poke open the squeeze hole i tried just squeezing but it did not work so i ended up using an ice pick you can probably use the tip of a knife or a prong of a fork too beyond using a measuring cup there is no real way to figure out exactly how much of a squeeze is required for an bottle of water or a water bottle so the user is left to guestimate it took about a of the bottle over several days before i was able to get close to what i think was the proper amount the biggest issue i had with this energy drink was the flavor personally i think it tastes horrible it is supposed to be a fruit punch flavored additive however it tastes more like liquid sweet tarts it has a very strong acidic aftertaste that completely eradicates the initial sweetness that one tastes after i got down to less than a bottle i tried drinking the vitamin squeeze directly from the bottle i thought it might help with the flavor i was completely wrong the horrible sweet tart taste just became even more pungent so though vitamin squeeze fruit punch energy drink does seem to provide a short burst of energy and has lots of vitamins the positives are almost wiped out by the horrible taste personally i would take a energy drink or a can of no fear over this energy drink ,0
original review i must be a freak because i really like this granola and can not stand some of the other gluten free granolas that get much better ratings here on amazon i do not know why i like it but even though the berry flavor tastes a bit artificial i like its tangy semi sweetness a lot better than the awful maple and apple cinnamon ones that i have tried i think those taste even more fake and much too sweet i guess i am not a fan of eating a lot of sugar on my cereal and this one tastes less sweet than some of the others i guess it is really a matter of personal taste i am going against the crowd on this one i just ordered a have to change my review i ordered six of these but what i received is not the same product that i have been buying in my local grocery store either they have changed it to make it worse or amazon is selling old stock and the one in the grocery store is the improved version plus i got heartburn big time from this one and never had it before from the grocery store item i did not like it at all am donating the remaining packages to a homeless shelter or a gluten intolerant friend two stars now ,0
better than thought theyd be a excellent choice for a great snack at work never got close to getting sick of them and will buy again ,1
who needs an entire box of mints that is what i thought when i was purchasing these but all packs were gone after my friends tried them in my car and decided they loved it it does not have the crazy shoots up your nose minty taste like the altoids but it is also not really sugary and sweet either where your whole mouth smells good afterwards but is covered in gritty sugar they hold up well in the car no melting or getting mushy like gum i have a box at work in the purse in my car it is also good at keeping me awake when i am tired on the road i also like the fact that they are mints and not gum i can pop one in my mouth right before seeing someone and it will have melted away before the actual meeting no hunting for the wrapper to throw it away ,1
i gave this a four star because my dogs as puppies loved these however i noticed as they got bigger and the chews got smaller they became choke hazards i recommend for light chewers or small dogs only ,1
i am more of a black tea drinker but numi is magnolia green puerh tea sounded delicious i was not disappointed there is no need for sweeteners since the tea is very palatable on its own there is little to no after taste unlike many green teas i have tried the fragrance of the magnolias is confined to scent you can not taste herbs in it it is also a great tea to drink with a meal as it is a palate cleanser i found that out quite by accident when i tried it alongside a rather pungent cheese excellent tea and i will be purchasing this again it is well worth the money be sure to follow the steeping instructions only leave the bag in for minutes and do not squeeze the bag that will release the bitterness of the tea and detract from the natural qualities it is perfect right at about minutes when the tea is a medium golden brown ,1
gluten free flours require some type of replacement for the gluten found in other flours xanthan gum is the best option we have found and brm brand is the best quality we have found and we have been at the gluten free diet for a decade now ,1
these suckers have great flavors and the are not itty bitty or filled with something like the ones you find in the stores wish they sold them in local stores for us who would like a deceit size and delicious sucker without gum or tootsie rolls inside ,1
bought these for my god daughters birthday party the lollipops are cute but they lacked taste some of the children licked them and then tossed them ,0
my son is a very fussy eater and wants to do everything himself at months and these are good for him and allow him to do that love the products and peter rabbit ones,1
hi frustrated with amazon and arrowhead mills have only recieved box becareful i am working on getting an exchange amazon will not refund my return arrowhead mills is not interested in helping because they are not the orginal supplier two years ago i received moldy bread from amazon and ener g took care of me what a difference my last order from amason of arrowhead mils products was wrong too they sent me whole wheat cookie mix instead of gluten free hmmm someone is dropping the ball for arrowhead mills ,0
a lot of cats do not like chunky types of food however these whiskas pouches have become my cat is favorite meal for me they are extremely easy just tear open a pouch fill her dish discard the pouch it was very easy to order them online the price was comparable to regular store prices and shipping was free and fast just keep in mind these are not smooth canned foods these are big chunks in sauce make sure your cat likes them before ordering in bulk ,1
while this soup tasted pretty good i just can not get over all the chunks of shell in almost every bite it really made this an unpleasant experience to eat i do not know if this is normal for this product or if this was just a bad batch but i was picking bits of shell out of my mouth with almost every bite not a fun experience ,0
i have a scottie and apparently his weight was what saved him interestingly my dog would not take the treat the second time i offered him one thank heaven within hours of giving him this product he started throwing up and the treat came up almost intact because it had not digested i took him into the vet when he started crying and was listless the vet said if jamie had been a smaller dog the treat could have killed him so i am out for my vet and associated medicine i am stunned amazon would even handle this product ,0
if you are raw foodist and or vegan who is interested in organic raw food you will love this other people who are used to processed stuff will not love it as other more processed stuffs tend to taste better i love it raw cacaol is such a natural high antioxident source that i try to find a way to eat it easily and here is a way as far as i know the only two other anti oxident that is as strong as raw cacol or more is jason winter is tea and mangosteen fruit drink extract ,1
this gum is a favorite of mine the intense rush of herbal extracts and caffiene makes one wake up fast i recommend this to anyone who fancies a good shock to the tastebuds ,1
this is the worst chili i have ever had used can and took the rest back to costco for refund i have never returned food products to costco for this reason ,0
it is very hard to find this product at all in the store this was a great find and a great deal ,1
we try a lot of different coffees but this one has been by far one of the very best it is full bodied yet smooth with no harshness at all youcould call it a true liquid comfort food ,1
hubby had to switch to gluten free because of gluten intolerance so we tried this and made pancakes they were great and had sort of a corn bread texture to it fyi i made cobbler from an regular bisquick recipe not gluten free and the measurements do not transfer the proportions are different with the gluten free mix so make sure you have the right recipe for what you are making ,1
i have never been a really big coffee drinker not much for hot liquids so i thought i would give one of these cold coffees a try i drank it in the late afternoon just before a charity event i was working wow this kept me going all night long i did not get home till one in the morning with enough energy still to read a bit the taste was a lot better than i thought it would be i have looked for it stores and have not found it yet ,1
my cats loved these mice and immediately tore open the velcro catnip closure this can be quite messy i refilled with my homegrown catnip more of a whole leaf than the dusty powder you get in the stores ,1
i never received my cookies it says they have been delivered but when i contacted the company to tell them ive never got them they told me to contact the post office who said they did not have them the company did nothing about this matter not very good customer service at all ,0
my two kittens have sensitive stomachs so my vet recommended science diet it helped them and i could not be any more pleased it is worth the price to see the results of happy pets that are healthy ,1
have used this product for many years in my coffee i like it and unlike newer products the price is reasonable and the quality good it does not cause cancer and is old enough so we are unlikely to be surprised by bad reactions most of the stores i frequent have ceased selling it due to the massive advertising campagins of the newer stuff like splensa which i think is extremely high priced or now stevia will continue using my saccharine tablets ,1
wow i had one yesterday and all afternoon and night i was filled with gas i could not figure out what i ate that caused this but i loved them so much that i was looking on line for a place to order a big box i am so happy that i came across the reviews on amazon otherwise i would have ordered more boxes and had to get rid of them one thing i do know is that if your body is not used to a lot of fiber that it can upset your stomach what you may want to do it gradually introduce it into your diet i e start with a third of one and see if that bothers you if it does then its not the fiber its something else in the bar this is what i am going to try because i really like them thanks for all of the reviews because i am not sure i would have figured it out there is a blog on the internet about these bars complaining about the same thing they actually wrote to the company and received a response back that they all had a good laugh for the day the blogger said that there is chicory root in the bars and that can cause gi problems i will have to look at the ingredient list myself then look up the chicory root if its not that then its the fiber which means you have to gradually get your body used to it ,0
back in a colleague tim and i were on a business trip to cincinnati tim knew about this great bbq place so it was an easy decision as to where to eat dinner that night we went to the original montgomery inn and needless to say i had the best full slab of ribs i would ever had since then i have been buying mi sauce and it is a killer bbq sauce not too hat but just warm enough read the label you do not cook with the sauce on the meats first you cook the meat with a dry rub of your choice they do not tell you that then after the meat is done you heat up some mibbq sauce and just pour it on i do not think you can overdose on it that is the way it is done and it is just phenomenal recently business took me back to cincinnati after some years guess what the mi was only minutes from the hotel went back ordered another full slab w baked potato hog heaven ,1
i have only used the unbleached whole wheat bread flour it was terrific i used it for homemade tortillas and banana bread it is great i will not purchase cornmeal again because it does not say it is gmo free if this company goes gmo free i may buy everything from them as long as the price stays fair ,1
i had read that organic coconut oil was good for healing skin yeast infections so i thought i would try it this is alot of coconut oil for the price it smells clean and like coconut of course it cleared up my minor infection within days i use the oil all over now because it goes on smoothly and absorbs into the skin rather quickly do not leave it in the sun because the heat will warm it to liquid ,1
ever since brach is and a w quit their contract for rootbeer barrels my husband has been missing them in his candy stash he was very happy to find these dad is rootbeer barrels in his stocking on christmas i enjoy these more than the a w ones there is more to the flavor than just sweetness also they are a long lasting candy you can suck on one for many minutes before it runs out ,1
i love bali is coffee candy it is just like a cup on the go i like the original best but family members like the espresso and latte better this assortment gives all three and they are all good if you love coffee ,1
with so many different pez dispensers out there how can i say that you ask there are a couple of reasons first most pez dispensers are simply that pez dispensers they perform no other function unless you count catching dust this one is also a pullback car which crosses the floor at a pretty good clip second i am old enough to remember when pez dispensers actually shot the candy into your mouth trial lawyers ended that fun modern pez dispensers are designed to merely push a piece of candy out far enough so that you can grab it with your fingers however these pez dispensers use an entirely different mechanism and at least in some of them when you push down the button at the front you can bounce candy off the ceiling note should you be so lucky as to acquire one of these accidental throwbacks please be content to catch the candy in your mouth on the rebound off the ceiling and for god is sake do not tell a trial lawyer there are seven other models that i know of differing only in plastic color paint and decals pez candy dispenser nascar race car black daytona anniv comes with three rolls of pez candy note a randomly selected three out of these four and is also available here ,1
this light roast is absolutely delicious i normally buy dark roasts but my husband wanted me to get some lighter roast k cups for him i was was so pleasantly surprised at how much flavor this coffee has i would highly recommend this ,1
it is true i like to spice up food and one of my favorite ways of doing this is through the classic hot sauce mcilhenney is tabasco sauce the hot peppery taste is a part of what makes buffalo chicken wings buffalo chicken wings at least using the recipe that i have i routinely add a few drops to gravy or spaghetti sauce eggs and omelettes sometimes to salad dressing and so on since the rest of my family is not so hot about this product needless to say i end up serving them tabasco sauce free versions of what i eat anyhow for spicing up food this is a never go wrong way of doing so ,1
i love amazon and i love these bars but ordering off of the internet is not the way to go on these and i should have listened to the other reviews in this case you get what you pay for i but these religiously at multiple stores locally and they are always soft and fresh as other reviewers mentioned ordering from amazon they come in hard as rocks inedible and when i went to return them they say you cant i will be contacting my cc company as i paid some dollars for stale food will not be ordering these again very disappointed ,0
i got this for hubby to try and he loves it he has poor vision and had not noticed the flakes over the past few years but they were there one use with the shampoo and his hair is soft smells nice and no little flakes from my point of the view the bonus is how both the men is and the women is clear shampoos hold down the overpowering odor some health and beauty aids dump in their products because of fragrance allergies because this shampoo is fragrance was so mild i can stand to be around my husband after he shampoos ,1
i tried this and liked it now i am loving it i have bought all the flavors and prefer fruit punch strawberry and sweet tea the most the flavor is not for the shy a little goes a long way in some ways it is similar to crystal light which i have enjoyed for decades for those mature enough to remember that product was launched with linda evans at the time dynasty is krystal crystal light is also a kraft product mio is easier to use and has better color and is super easy to transport to the office to the gym where ever you might be the fruit punch reminds me of a popsicle at a theme park in my case is and is needless to say a very positive memory so far i have used it in regular and sparkling water and enjoyed it have also used it with a sodastream unit with excellent results but the best is with crushed ice much like a sno cone beyond good just put it in a personal or regular size blender add some ice and seconds later a refreshing treat perfect after a workout a run or just a long day okay i admit one could add a dash of vodka to that as well for an evening event yum ,1
at calories and of saturated fat and lots of msg and preservatives you can not eat this often it is a good snack because there is not much of it and it is spicy so it is exciting to eat it is what you would expect out of a spicy flavored ramen except it is conveniently already in a cup i only wish it was healthier ,1
i was really excited to try this product as i am a huge fan of their bars it was very good it is always great to find a source for omega is the amazing variety of grains used in this is a selling point to me i like the variety and it is not over sweet i do like granola that is not all broken up into tiny little pieces but has some chunks in it which this does have kind granola is also gluten free and vegan friendly if you are on a restricted diet this is perfect i thought the cinnamon was just the right amount not overpowering to me things that are healthy for you are not very useful unless they taste good too this tastes good enjoy it on yogurt or out of the bag or with milk i put it in little baggies and throw it in my backpack for a snack at school ,1
i have spent a lot of time getting water from baby coconuts its definitely worth the price to just open a packahge an drink a bigger portion than any single coconut has ever supplied me ,1
got to love these bars made with nothing but the healthiest stuff dates cashews nectar etc i think this flavor is one of their best and most people would probably be okay with it if they are used to these kinds of things really it is like a mini meal unto itself and these should be a part of every child adult is diet support raw revolution and other non gmo products made with healthy ingredients your body will love you ,1
this was the only place i could find this product it is not in stores anywhere it is my favorite ,1
i have two cats one is a ragdoll and one is a rescue both of them like the gravies in canned cat food but they will not even go near this product turn up their noses and high tail it the other way can not even get them near it tried both containers i ordered thinking it might just be the first one i opened nope they will not even touch it wasted my money on this purchase ,0
pricey but worth it you can mix your own strength the taste is easy to swallow and easy on the stomach and it is easy to drink even after hours on the bike when it is no longer cold mark your bottle so you know which one is fuel as it is clear once mixed ,1
this was so not worth the buy i think they had a horrible after taste and just did not like them at all ,0
we love ordering this stuff doesnt last long in my house though takes longer to recive than to eat it ,1
i have tried this and the zico this tastes much better than the zico has no additives and is not from concentrate i am weening off of some powerful medications the process dehydrates me drinking a can of coconut juice a day has made a big difference in helping me through the process this is great stuff ,1
with the density and shape of a cookie and the fragility of a cracker it is an interesting combination they have a shortbread like consistency a cranberry chewiness and a bit of oatmeal flavor as well each time i open the box which has re sealable tabs i have never seen before i get a waft of fruitiness i am hooked the ingredients are not listed on the product page so i had to seek them out elsewhere these cookies are dairy free and it appears they may even be vegan unbleached enriched flour wheat flour niacin reduced iron thiamine mononitrate vitamin riboflavin vitamin folic acid sugar whole grain wheat flour soybean and or palm oil rolled oats dried cranberries fructose salt baking soda soy lecithin natural flavor allergens and nutritional considerations added sugars gluten soy wheat,1
this cereal is awful after i eat one bowle then i feel like throwing it up it is discusting and i would never buy it again it tastes good but the feelings after eating it is gross it feels like you ate hamburgers i like the taste but after the after taste is gross ,0
this tree showed up quickly it was well packaged it was watered before it was wrapped and was well hydrated when it arrived i did not see any damage it was been outside for two days and it is doing great no yellow leaves it has new growth i would order from them again and am stopping by their store next time i am in the area looking now for more trees to add to my collection and to send one to my mother and mother in law ,1
these are delicious i could easily eat the whole thing at one sitting they are slightly sweet and salty just right and they are healthy ,1
yes there is sometimes a slight taste to the water but it is not bad most other high alkaline waters i have found are purified and i appreciate that this water is sourced from glacier water in british columbia i have a very sensitive alkaline acid balance and i can feel the effects of the water as i drink it i find it calming to my nervous system while it strengthens my heat tolerance on hot northern california days ,1
nestle is smarties are better then m m is and have a perfect blend of sweetness and chocolate taste have been enjoying them since my childhood and still enjoy them in my is ,1

i recommend this soup it is delicious filling and nutritious some people might find it too spicy or salty but i like it that way it takes about minutes to make it is really easy too just boil cups water add soup mix bring back to boil and cook for minutes one package makes servings i am on the weight watcher is program and have found this product to work nicely in the program it counts as points ,1
this must be the best deal anywhere on a real cuppa i keep expecting the price to fluctuate like gasoline but amazon are considerate to us limeys the best deal is to subscribe and get it delivered regularly are you not going to drink it all the time when i give it to my american friends i feel a little guilty at getting them hooked i gave away a few boxes this christmas to erstwhile coffee drinkers ,1
i bought a box of this cereal last night at my local wal mart and i could not wait to try it this morning this is delicious i normally try to eat shredded wheat non sugar coated for the health benefits and i have to say this is the best shredded wheat i have ever eaten i would prefer that this did not have sugar in it but at least its natural and organic sugar and it does not taste really sweet the vanilla gives a very nice flavor and i really like the texture of this cereal it is got more of a natural texture than most other shredded wheat cereals i have tried i think this might be my new favorite cereal ,1
husband and i love this drink mix can be prepared in less than minutes especially nice on cold nights ,1
this was my first time making almond milk the bag worked really well and i could not believe how much fiber nut is left in the bag very happy with this product it would be nice like someone mentioned if they would include a receipe with it on how to make almond milk ,1
if you like gummy candy you will love this product i lived in australia for a year and became addicted to this product this is by far my most favorite candy in the world you wont regret buying it ,1
finally a flavored sugar splenda is awesome does not create sugar imbalance in your body which is the weight gainer the mocha is absolutely the best of the three offered and i am a french vanilla fan usually the french vanilla is a close second and the hazelnut is a distant third one packet of flavored and one plain packet is perfect for one travel sz mug no need to use two flavored packets as one packs a pretty good punch which is good since they are a little pricey the only con is that they are difficult to open since there is no small start tear on the top you have to open it with your teeth and they are the tall plastic packets vs regular sugar size paper ones a stupid con i know but nothing can be perfect can it ,1
wasa are a staple inour house low calorie high fiber and good tasting they were an excellent price at amazon they are difficult to find in our local stores and when we do they are out rageous a price ,1
never had a problem with this brand i use alot of chile powder to make my own no salt seasonings and this does the trick for the price easy to store plastic shaker bottle slender enough for easy grip ,1
i ordered the rhubarb strawberry pie filling and it was great and very well packed no damage even though it was glass containers,1
i love coconut but this coffee tastes like tanning lotion i could not even finish my cup of coffee which is very rare two thumbs down ,0
this drink is not one of the best i have used the taste is medicinal i have better results energy and calorie burning wise with celcius and vpx drinks the celcius available for really great value at costco and the vpx among many others at amazon or vitamin shop blue sky enters this market with a poor tasting product and hopes to overcome it is shortfall by claiming it is all natural too bad ,0
i am a fan of coconut so i was happy to see this as a flavor the coffee and coconut flavor are both mild and i usually prefer a bolder coffee jet fuel is one of my favorites but i like the smell and hint of coconut it is a little trip to the tropics every morning ,1
of course these do not taste as great as the cereal bars but they are way better than most protein bars this is the only flavor i have tried and they are not fabulous but definitely edible i am looking forward to trying the chocolate peanut butter flavor and hey i have lost pounds ,1
ok for anyone who is interested in making their own kombucha get this kit my first batch was wonderful as good as the stuff you pay for at whole foods we have continued on with experimentation trying fruity green teas adding in fruit after fermentation etc and the original scooby that gets mailed to you has afforded us with new scoobys we have different jars going now with a variety of teas so much fun this kit is wonderful and could not be easier to follow thank you ,1
this is my favorite lower calorie drink it is healthy refreshing and i do not feel guilty drinking it because of too much sugar ,1
this cereal reminded my kids of rice crispies in terms of flavor it has flakes that resemble corn flakes puff balls that resemble kix and rice puffs that resemble ricke crispies the kids thought they were okay but i am sure the flavor could definitely grow on them over time they did not reject eating it i really enjoyed the flavor it was slightly sweet with a subtle vanilla flavor i honestly liked them more for a dry snack in place of granola as opposed to having them with milk in fact adding in a few almonds this became a definite replacement for granola in a pinch if you are already a eater of more healthy cereal this will be right up your alley if you are looking to do a diet change from some of the more traditional high sugar highly processed cereal it may take a few tries to get your palate used to the flavor would definitely recommend at least giving it a try especially if you like a slightly sweet cereal as opposed to more sugar coated sort of cereals ,1
i was so excited to see the crusty looking french bread on the front of the box i bought it and went home to make it immediately however i was very disappointed because the texture is more like buscuits than the bread on the cover and it looks nothing like the cover in texture either i will not be buying this again because i have a better biscuit recipe no need to spend the money and not get the expected result ,0
this is simply the best tasting bottled water i have had and i go out of my way to find it i have never personally had any aftertaste i can buy the large bottle at a barnes noble and drink it all many people in hawaii drink fiji at least i noticed that on my trips there and they love fresh things ,1
this fruit juice is amazing it is sweet but not too sweet i am really happy with this purchase and it was quite a good deal as well ,1
i bought some of this yesterday at a rather large kroger this morning for breakfast i had some coffee a bowl of cereal and some toast with this brand of soy nut butter it looks like peanut butter smells like peanut butter and even tastes like peanut butter in fact i think this tastes better than any garden variety peanut butter you see in the store it has a great nutty taste and it is not overly sweet this is a winner ,1
i love this coffee it tastes fantastic stars without a doubt i have to take a star away because of the delivery amazon is delivery service here in jersey city nj never delivers to my address they deliver to a street with a similar name instead of ave they deliver to st there is no on the street the street names are pronounced similarly but spelled pretty different times i have had this problem the courier always shows up with an attitude because he gets yelled at for messing up i wont be ordering this from amazon anymore until their shipping issues are dealt with i pay for prime and it is taken over a week and resends to get my coffee ,1

i recently got a new cat off of craigslist the previous owners had said that he was not a very picky eater i went to the store to find what i thought i should get for my new pet i had looked at iams indoor formula and was going to with that however i saw evolve and what really caught my eye was that it is made in the usa i could not find where iams was made it was not on the package so i figured that i would give it a shot mind you evolve only cost more cents than a of iams my cat instantly took a liking to it what i had noticed for the first day or so was that my cat is stools smelled really bad however after a few days on evolve that smell has greatly reduce it could have been what the previous owners were feeding him the only problem that i do have with it is yes the stools are generally soft and can sometimes get on fur but if you love your cat enough you are willing to do anything for him overall my cat and i really like this pet food and i would recommend it to anyone ,1

rather than a sampler of different coffee types this appears to be a way to get rid of damaged or outdated goods and get paid for it there was not even a good sampling as i had three each of several blends and not one of each as i would expect from a sampler just about all of the individual k cups were damaged in one way or another as well ,0

i can not believe how bad this stuff was i opened the noodle package and it smelled stale and awful the dehydrated vegetables did not hydrate in the microwave time i even added more time and so i was crunching on them while trying to eat the noodles it was not a good crunch the saving grace was the szechuan sauce which was good but not good enough to cover the bad i would rather have cup noodles than this stuff ,0

i am impressed by halo is products although the canned food variety is the only thing i had previously tried when i was babying my dog while she was recuperating after her spay surgery i can feel good about feeding her such wholesome food and she devours it this was my first time buying halo treats even though the package says they are for dogs lbs my lb one year old terrier mix is still in the puppy stage and is an avid chewer i was looking for a product to change it up from the old reliable rawhide for something she would not demolish in minutes and something different than meat flavored treats for variety i was unsure if she would go for the pumpkin flavor but this was an instant hit she loves the taste of these treats and has no problem chewing them i gave her a whole stick and she worked on it kept her occupied for about minutes until it was completely gone they smell really good like pumpkin pie spice and although they are dark brown in color they do not stain like some of the red colored rawhide products i have tried i have gone through half the bag so far sticks in a bag giving her one every few days and she really enjoys them i am definitely buying these again and i am going to try the mint variety and see if that is a winner too i would recommend that even if you have a small dog give them a try to switch up your choice of hard chew treats if your puppy or dog is a big chewer ,1

it smells soooooooo good and it is so creamy i do not know if they sell clear products in the store but if i see them in the store i plan to buy them as for dandruff i have not seen any so it may be working i am not sure since i also use the clear scalp oil which may be masking the dandruff i also have been using a new conditioner cream of nature argan oil so i do not know if this product improved the condition or what but my hair is not shedding like it usually does update clears up dandruff problems but strips hair color immediately if you have a hair color i would advise not using this shampoo too much ,1

i read somewhere that delta dust deltamethrin will kill hornets and that terro ant dust has this ingredient i purchased it and a plant duster poured in the powder and dusted down the hole of the hornets it is killing them for sure i was seeing swarms before but in just days of use the population is definitely on the decline i used it on some ants too and it works on them very well the active ingredient is a cousin to permethrin pyrethrin etc which are synthetics of the active ingredient found in chrysanthemums delta dust has a long life on the ground as it is water proof so kills bugs for months my problem is that in this summer drought wasps hornets are of the same family and other bugs pests are drawn to our yard here in the country i have to spray new nests as they pop up cons can be hard to find i finally found some at a local hardware store for about bucks canister with sprinkler pour spout the duster was found at a local seed and feed store it was about bucks ,1

if you grew up in south africa this would just have a place in your heart it is like tomato sauce in that i put it on eggs roasts into stew on fries chips for those from uk or sa especially good with meatloaf i can not rate it high enough perhaps being south african i am slightly biased thanks amazon for stocking this ,1
i only like the light sodium varieties as i think the others have too much salt for such small servings this one uses whole wheat couscous ,1
this clear strong full anti dandruff shampoo does work well to control dandruff and it also leaves my hair feeling very clean i am a long time head shoulders user and generally default back to it when shopping but will consider this specific type from clear if it is comparably priced my hair is normally very oily so i like that this is a little stronger than most other dandruff shampoos without having an overpowering scent recommended cfh,1

do not waste your time the beef sticks are not good the flavor is fake and nothing like a real beef stick the texture will almost make you gag you do not even need to chew these beef sticks there is a reason why you can get this amount of volume at the price not worth it ,0
this is a great waffle mix i have allergies to preservatives and to find food in general that is great tasting without the preservatives is a huge challenge i have tried several other mixes and this one is by far the best i totally do not understand the reviews about the bad taste and all the chemicals read labels of other mixes and you will see this one is not full of all those ingredients there are certain kinds of ingredients that these mixes need such as levening and when you use real butter not the tub butter that contains water and other nasty stuff these are the best waffles ever ,1
product is wonderful price jump at beginning of year was very very upsetting it jumped per shipment from around to it is still a good price at but when a customer subscribes at a certain price i really think it should stay at that price and if the need to raise the price arises the customer should be informed first and given the option of opting out before having to be shocked at the email received that says oh look your subscribe and save stuff is ready to ship and oh by the way its now this much higher after all the subscribe and save option is to save money not have the prices increased on us so we pay almost as much as those who dont use this option i do not subscribe to too many things for that reason ,1
this pasta is delicious and makes me feel i am making a healthy choice with this brand ,1
in the infamous words of sir glenn quagmire yes yes yes this is really the best hot sauce i have ever tasted and although i have only ordered it from very asian they were johnny on the spot with my order ,1
excellent tea and i would recommend it to anyone that has not tried it but that loves tea i drink it with just a teaspoon of sugar no milk and it gets my day started the right way the big problem with this product is that the price is like a yo yo bouncing all over the place i finally stopped my subscription because of the price jumps and due to the fact that the product is currently much cheaper at walmart and target the current amazon price is while i can buy it at the above mentioned places for a box sure it is only cents but when you drink as much as i do this price difference is like buying and getting one free at the local shops ,1
xylitol is fantastic for dental health these mints are great because they do not contain any of the less than ideal additives like aspartame nutrasweet saccharin sorbitol mannitol artificial flavors artificial colors etc that make most other gums and mints even those with xylitol as an ingredient problematic the flavor is nice the texture is fine the appearance is normal just a cute little white tablet note that these mints are manufactured in finland and the xylitol is sourced from birch wood also it is non gmo not genetically modified which is not the case with some other brands of xylitol products which source their xylitol from china and or from corn i wish that these mints could be purchased in smaller amounts because the price for the of these giant containers is quite a lot of money to spend on something you have never tried before i am sure more people would give them a try if they packaged this in a portable little cardboard box or something and sold it as an add on product at amazon for dollars or something just so folks could try them out ,1
this is the only microwave popcorn that my family will eat large pieces just the right amount of butter flavor not too salty unfortunately all of the grocery stores in my city have quit carrying it on the shelves can not get an answer why which is why i have ordered it on line thanks amazon for stocking this and for the quick delivery ,1
i ordered this item and the next day i tried to cancel it as i found it cheaper in the store they had not processed my order yet but they did not let me cancel anything when i received the product the expiration date was close by ordered it in end march and it will expire in june how the heck do you use packs of peanut butter in months i am truly disappointed in this seller ,0

to be completely and fair i have tried this product before and enjoyed it the only part that concerns me is that this product is manufactured in china with no information on the sources of the fruits on their website they say they source fresh fruit and that we are not concerned about issues surrounding where our product is produced because we take great care to ensure the quality and food safety of our products i am not suggesting that this product is bad which is why i gave it stars but i share more of a concern than evidently the company does as to where they are getting this fruit processing it and shipping it with the history china has had with kid is toys formula etc in the past let is just say we do not feed these products to our child i would love it if the company would provide a tour and exact explanation of the process and sources rather than discounting that information all together ,1
smelled nice upun first opening the package the entire pack crushed well inside the pack without spilling out brewed a pot then drank a cup black with spoons of sugur which the way i like to drink coffee found it to be medium bodied with a normal coffee aftertaste the chocolate flavor is a nice addition without being overpowering not one of the better coffees out there but still worth drinking in my opinion ,1
i found this to be a nice alternative to juice and to the usual pepsi that i normally drink it had a nice light flavor with just a little carbonation i do not believe tangerine is the right name for the taste i would say a tart orange juice is more accurate however the name of the drink does not take away from the quality of the product i let my children try a little bit of this and they too thought it was a very good taste the cans are small smaller than a coke can but i found one to quench my thirst better than any of the caffeinated drinks i would normally pick up ,1
excellent product and delivered exactly as promised when i am in need of a refill will definitely use amazon igourmet ,1

usually when i drink coffee i brew at home flavored and non flavored i am compelled to add a good amount of cream and sugar in order to enjoy it this coffee however is different i actually drink it black and truly enjoy the flavor it has a phenomenal aroma that lasts for the duration of the bag amazon however is charging too much for new england coffee it is cheaper at the grocery store when the grocery store does not have it on sale amazon grocery and cheaper when it is on sale,1
well if you want some tea you cant go wrong with this i picked it up atta good price from the good ol gold box can not beat it at the price ,1
i like strong black coffee i like it to taste strong have body wake me up the way to make strong coffee is use more grounds per water but that does not guarantee it tastes good jet fuel tastes good wakes me up it seems at least a time a half stronger than most other coffees is full bodied is consistently equally great cup after cup i have had a hundred of them so far it is my favorite i bought cups on sale for but the regular price at the time was only since you will probably only need one cup in the morning it is a great deal also it arrived less than hours after the order was put in,1
tastes great and is packed with protein a nutritious snack that stops hunger chocolate dipped mixed nuts is my favorite thinkthin flavor ,1
our friends from brittany france sent these to us so we could have a taste of france we received a box with a combination of plain and chocolate covered crepes they are deceptively plain looking but you bite into thin golden flaky crepes rolled thinly into a couple inches of delicate buttery crunchy goodness they are so wonderful and ours are all gone so i came here looking for more i am so happy to find them the chocolate covered are delicious too but my favorite are the plain they are fantastic with coffee or with ice cream try them ,1

this kashi cereal packs a nutritional punch with grams of protein including soy protein plus grams of fiber it has a nicely sweet taste similar to sugar smacks for kids as promised it is definitely crunchy but i actually found it a bit too crunchy my jaw started to ache after just a few spoonfuls however i found that if i gave the cereal some time to soften a bit in the milk first i could enjoy it much more recommended as a healthy tasty way to start your day ,1
first off you do not need of meat my wife and i used the recommended ingredients and we found that was too much we actually could not finish our initial portions because it had too much meat also we did not use all the cheese between the two of us of the velveeta cheese was enough other than that it was a great cheeseburger skillet meal with that great velveeta cheesy taste we all like took a little longer than minutes between the two of us but it turned out great in the end and we ended up with leftovers for another meal or two ,1
if i were to sugget one food to those that might be new to the allergy world it would be this product my four year old son was just diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis and tested positive for several allergies i am so glad that i found these cookies during our first week of restricted diets and if you have a young child with many allergies you probably will be grateful for the extra calories in these cookies i let my son have an abundance of these cookies in his diet in hopes to bulk him up a bit i have let other family members try them that do not suffer from allergies and i have not had a bad reaction yet they really are good my only warning would be that they are more muffin like than most cookies my four year old was a little upset when he saw these because he was expecting cookies that look like cookies either way he tried them and he likes them ,1
i only wish they had this stuff when my kids were little they would have definitely eaten all of their vegetables then i tasted this baby food before i gave it to my best friend for her daughter to try and it tastes pretty damn good for being just baby food lemme tell ya her daughter loves it and inhales it when it comes time to eat now it is all that my friend buys for her although i do find it to be kind of expensive the nutritional value is high and if the babies like it then why not ,1
these are certainly an acquired taste the most interesting thing to happen is when a cuban friend came over and was so taken with the aroma that is because they use lavender on babies he was the only one to try one and finish it my son and i like them for the refreshing taste they give to you they help cleanse the palate ,1

these things are nothing like oreos you think wow oreos think again i would say spend your money on something better the hershey is or reese is crisp wafer bars come to mind my honest view on these thin crisps cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer or milk bones ,0
my girls love these and i would never want to not have them in my house they are buttery flavored and delicious and i admit to eating them myself ,1
i have enjoyed this product for many many years i was terribly disappointed when i discovered it was no longer available in any store you can only imagine my excitement when i found out that it was available thru amazon i so enjoyed the first case i purchased that i bought a second case the first two cans from the second case i bought were marvelous believe me when i use up this case i will be buying a third case joel,1
this is definitely gourmet carmel smooth rich and not too sweet great texture and nice sized bite chunks carmel is a great medium to carry other flavors and this has room for improvement to my pallet at least the honey and orange is just a bit too faint flavors are there and add to the enjoyment but need to be a little stronger but overall still recommended ,1
my boyfriend has intolerances to most grains so i got him an almond flour cookbook so he could try making things he normally can not eat scones pancakes pies bread etc he uses this grapeseed oil in most of the recipes and they have turned out great so far he also sometimes uses it in place of olive oil and vegetable oil if he wants a heart healthy oil without the stronger olive oil taste ,1
i am a major fan of the cornucopia kits and this kit was the third kit of theirs i bought the wine was great but as one reviewer pointed out the labels are misspelled that is just a minor issue and was good for a few laughs ,1

first this product package is about the size of a cool aid package approximately x it comes in a sealing foil package similar to cool aid i ordered this through the vine program and to my amazement this small package of powdered drink mix came in a box big enough for books it came in a x box stuffed full of protective air bubbles while i appreciate good packaging the waste here completely turned me off it was incredible the product itself was so so not terrible but not really good either it is definitely not something that i would replace my green tea or peppermint tea with during the day so i do not see myself drinking it or desiring it if you something a bit different you may want to give it a try but i was not very impressed with either the taste or the waste associated with this product and will not be using it again ,0
we used parent is choice formula with our twins the hospital sent us home with a bunch of samples of a name brand formula when we ran out and went to the store to get more we had sticker shock once we realized how expensive it was going to be to feed twins unfortunately i physically could not breast feed so formula was a necessity we sat down in the aisle at the store pulling cans of the various formulas off of the shelf and comparing the nutrition labels it was surprising to see that they were all just about the same thing yes the parent is choice was half the price and for a larger container we did a little more research about infant formula and found out that due to certain guidelines made by the fda all infant formulas are required to be made nutritionally equal so we did not have to worry about sub par nutrition or having to use more to get the right nutrients etc it was essentially buying the same formula with a different label price in the course of a year of formula feeding twins we saved nearly we used that money to get other things that they needed ,1
let me start by saying this is not a bad tasting oatmeal if the description said it was regular oatmeal with flaxseed i would give it stars however calling this product flaxseed cinnamon and blueberry flavored is outright false and misleading i might have spotted blueberry in my bowl after emptying packets there is not even any blueberry flavor to this oatmeal or cinnamon flavor either ,0
while i usually eat granola bars for a quick snack they are not especially good for you nutritionally i decided to try something different and went with the fruition strawberry bar they are calories with calories from fat they have very low sodium and are vegan to boot i like the taste a lot it has a definite fruity taste and is not sickeningly sweet or cloying like some of the granola bars i have had in the past the texture is soft and moist and will not leave a ton on crumbs in your lap as you snack i like nibbling a bit as i drink my tea since they are soft and moist they stand up to being in a jacket pocket or a backpack and will not disintegrate into a pile of crumbs as you hike one warning they are more likely to appeal to the adult palate both of my kids vastly prefer the sweet granola snack bars do not be disappointed if your kids are not enamored with them bottom line tasty good for you and hiking friendly ,1
i guess when i think of superfood i think of sprulina these bars did not have much strawberry flavor but then again it also did not have the artificial flavor that you would expect from other snack products you would taste much more strawberry flavor in fresh strawberries we recieved a whole box which was much better getting one or two and so i was able to share with the family and got favorable feedback from all my family loved it much more than i thought they would i like to have them with my coffe in the morning as i get up much earlier than the family and i need something to eat before breakfast and this helps to have something good in my stomach they are also not chewy and gooey like some energy bars are they are also good for a snack before going to the gym if you need a little extra energy as i do but do not expect an overpowering strawberry flavor ,1
i purchased these jelly bellys as part of a gift for my deployed husband they are not allowed to drink over there but i wanted something for him to be able to reminisce about fun nights out this fit the bill wonderful taste like all jelly belly products ,1

i picked this up at the grocery store thinking oh this will make for a quick and cheap meal that is was as i ate it i thought to myself this is pretty tasty considering it came right from the box as the night went on my stomach started to get very upset it made me feel absolutely miserable stomach in knots cramping bloating gas diahrrea you know the works consider this a fair warning for anyone considering trying this product ,0
i love spicy food i have had various chili sauces but this is the best ever i agree it is addictive and hot so be warned ,1
i like my tea very strong which requires using a lot of tea when brewing tetley is a very reasonably priced good tasting blend i typically use tsp per of boiling water brewed for minutes brewing longer makes a stronger tea but introduces some unpleasant tastes my favorite is inexpensive kroger brand loose tea in a tin which i can no longer find tetley stands up nicely compared to the more expensive twinnings blends and i prefer tetley is taste ,1
mine arrived quickly in nice sample pack presentation boxes of each would definitely make a nice gift for any keurig lover the variety was great no complaints here ,1

i lived in italy and grew very accustomed to great coffee lavblu is as good as any i have had it costs a bit more in stores so if you order more than three cans or so it is probably saving you money if you order six or so as i do even with the shipping it is a bargain buy the rosa if you are making on the stove as this is too fine for a stove with a machine it is just outstanding new lines sales is easy to deal with quick and responsive,1
while the product itself is great and does exactly what it is intended for and is allergy friendly i would recomend it to anyonethat is looking for a glueten free stock ,1

this is supposed to be tender popcorn and it is anything but that and the seller will not respond to my emails requesting a refund i am very sorry i ordered this product ,0
i have two dogs that received this gift from santa and figured it out pretty quick since santa pre filled it they play with it until it is empty as most dogs would i suspect since they can smell the food inside they seem to really enjoy it the reason for stars instead of is that it needs really small bits of food treats and is not so easy to fill i end up with quite a bit of food on the floor while trying to fill it i might try to find some really small cookies to put inside to cut down on the frustration of filling it my dogs like it though and that is all that matters to me ,1
this product is great tasting and holds true to it is cree derived legacy certainly not true native american pemmican it is as close as any mass market jerky product has come this along with its brothers may be a bit expensive but it is a great splurge every now and then great tasting cut pieces of jerky paired with an separate berry composition be sure to try and eat meat and its counterpart together for an semi original pemmican taste ,1
this is a great meal choice when you simply do not have the time to cook microwaveable bowls saves time on having to do the dirty dishes the only drawback i see are the bowls are a bit too small would like to see chef boyardee make bigger bowls ,1
i highly recommend both the blood orange spread and the seller the spread is very flavorful and goes well with so many different foods ,1
i love these noodles they are my favorite ramen style packet food but not ramen i have been calling them chow mein for some time but other reviewers are right they are japanese yakisoba style noodles they are cheaper here on amazon than i can find them in stores but more importantly consistently available some local stores have them for but i have noticed they are incredibly difficult to find they seem to be carried randomly i will find a store that carries them buy a dozen and next time i go back they no longer carry them the noodles are a wonderfully sweet rich salty tangy ish flavor personally i love them but i know the flavor is not for everyone every time i cook them my husband always says ooh that smells good can i have a bite and immediately makes his gross face when he tastes it every time so its a love or hate kind of food but me i love them as a side note they come with a small packet of green seaweed type stuff but i hate the way it tastes and even smells ick so i always omit it and i am a vegetarian so these noodles are perfect for me pros quick to prepare flavorful cheap unique vegetariancons sometimes inconsistent availability outside amazon packet of green stuff personal preference i wish they had a packet size one packet is sometimes not enough two is too much ,1
spike is a seasoned salt that is great for cooking just about any kind of vegetable as vegetarians we rely on spike to provide the complex flavoring that carnivores obtain by adding meat without the time consuming process of cooking stocks we have used spike for years and now buy it in lb bulk which lasts us over a year we decant it into a smaller shaker spike keeps its flavor very well and we see no difference when switching from a year old to a new batch ,1

i never buy newman is own due to the price but i am glad i got a chance to try these cookies i am a medium fan of ginger snaps and i think the hardness of most of these cookies is the main reason these newman is are also very hard do not eat them with tender or soft teeth but they do taste strongly of ginger and they were sweet enough for me i have a definite sweet tooth so sweetness was important to me i do not know that they are that much healthier than the norm since i did not have a package of a different brand on hand when i tried these but i can not imagine ginger snaps being the worst type of cookie you can eat i suspect the taste of ginger means they do not have to sweeten them as much as regular cookies like sugar peanut butter choco chip etc i think the big thing to me is price i would not pay more than two fifty for the bag size i received good but not gourmet in my opinion ,1
i switched to this food to try and eliminate food allergies after spending hundreds of dollars at the vet for my dog who would not stop licking his paws raw within weeks he stopped licking and his hair stopped falling out i also mixed this dry food with evo venison in a can i took about a week to slowly switch over to the new food so now his only protein was venison and all grain free the food is expenspensive but cheaper than weekly vet visits and giving him steroids sprays baths make sure you do not give your dog anything else like rawhides treats or table food ,1
i received a sample through my summer beauty voxbox i got from influenster well let me say that it was so delicious that we went and bought two boxes and it and we have already ate all of them in less than a week ,1

i found this product online after deciding that keeping in business single handedly with my pumpkin latte addiction was not the best choice for my wallet i would read online that this is the same mix that uses but it is a lie this mix has much more spice in it or maybe i just got a bad batch and since i am technically allergic to cinnamon i can not really enjoy this i am bummed out because now i have i bunch of unopened tins of the stuff i am thinking of making care packages just to give them away ,0
good product a little pricey but something i purchase a couple times a year as a gift to myself easy to use and shipped well with temperature resistant packaging ,1

i drink a lot of crystal light and generally enjoy the fruity flavors the crystal light mocktails mojito mix does not bring me enjoyment this mojito mix is disgusting and after drinking a single half glass i am dumping the entire pitcher and throwing out the rest of the package yes it is that bad the synthetic mint flavor hits hard and continues to punish long after you have swallowed yuck yuck yuck my wife was not quite as offended but she agreed that it was not good and had no issue with me discarding the product ,0
i bought this thinking it would be good for my month old since he loves variety unfortunately i only got to let him try a few of them there was no packaging in the box and several jars broke there was food and glass all over the box and amazon will not let you return food items i did get a partial refund though but alas he likes the gerber food better ,0
i thought it was good sometimes you want to have a nice beverage at night that is not soda and is not alcohol not too sweet slightly fruity with that mildly harder taste on your pallette i am going to pick it up again ,1
this almond flour has been my saving grace i am on a very strict diet and this is the only flour i can have yes its a little expensive but its worth it its healthy and i have made the best muffins cookies breads and pancakes with it i now have my husband and kids loving all my new goodies as well ,1
my dogs loved them they would sit next to the counter where i kept them and wait for more ,1
these are good tasting cookies if you enjoy chocolate have a nice gooey chocolate center they also have nice texture i ususally enjoy best chewie chocolate chip type cookies these are harder but not too hard but that also does lead to their one drawback they do tend to crumble and with the chocolate in the middle that can get a bit messy one last positive point though at least for the pack of is a great snack size enough to feel full but not too much recommended ,1
we have had this door for over a year and it has been one of the best things i have ever purchased we have three dogs two large older dogs and one small we used to spend our day letting them out times to chase squirrels only to let them back in two minutes later the barking to go in and out was constant now their behavior is completely different they let themselves in and out no more barking and freedom for us when we are at work or gone long periods of time we no longer worry about getting home to let them out the only problem we have had with the door is that when it is really cold teens or below the door sometimes goes up and down a few times before it finally closes keeping in mind that it has probably opened and closed times in the last year i am happy with it is track record one of our older dogs is afraid of everything cameras phones etc i was afraid she would be too afraid to use it with some treats she learned to use it in about minutes and has had no problem since great product ,1
i absolutely loved this product at first i had one of the first models and it worked wonderfully until one day it simply would not turn on i called the company and they sent me a new model the steam chamber of the new model smells horrible i can not quite pinpoint the smell but it is somewhere between metallic and burnt plastic all the food i have steamed also has this metallic taste to it i have done the cleaning with distilled vinegar and distilled water twice already but the food still tastes metallic this freaks me out because i have no idea what is being deposited on the food obviously i will not be giving any steamed food to my baby i have called customer service again and i am waiting for a call back ,0

i was gullible enough to believe that these bags would be something other than oz each at a price of ea for what i would consider a cent convenience store item no wonderthey do not tell what the size of the bag is ,0
i would be the first to applaud these products if they were good unfortunately i would rather give up drinking that have to drink this tasteless slop there is a very nasty artificial acrid too citrusy while at the same time too sweet taste to these products the strawberry margherita mix has a very faint taste of strawberry but no amount of doctoring could make it drinkable i poured the mix out the mai tai mix poured it out i bought several bottle dry drink mixes of all their varieties without trying them first big mistake i am either going to pour them out or throw them out since the folks at baja bob is web site have refused to even respond to my request that i return the unopened products for a refund you will also note that on their web site is fan club page there are entries save your money unless you are totally desperate you would be better off using crystal light ruby red grapefruit now that tastes pretty good mixed with vodka ,0
one of the packages has already melted when i receive it another one is ok really upset about this ,0
not as much taste and body as the regular fever tree tonic when used with gin but still a marked inprovement to the schweppes and canada dry diet tonics if you have to have diet then this is the one to get no after taste but not much other taste either ,1
the only reason i am giving this stars instead of is because the item i received does not remotely resemble the picture it came in a coffee type mug instead of a pail and does not have the green colored paper the picture shows however it still looks pretty and my daughter will love it when she receives it for valentine is day ,1
after trying quite a few other brands at no small expense i have finally found something my pup will eat other brands though made for small dogs were still too large for my little guy is small mouth this one is small enough that he can chew it easily best of all he likes it he really likes it and it seems to be good for him too from reading the ingredients all around it is a great find at a decent price ,1

when we introduced beefy rice to our three kids sturgis the wonder peke bobette aka alien love child and ellie mae dobby diana our little rescue mix the response was overwhelmingly over the top happy they have always been pretty much tolerant of their dry food no one seemed to be doing the happy dance prior to meal time well except for emdd who spent her first year being horribly neglected she does the happy dance for just about anything now that her life has turned around anyway the first time i put just a small spoonful of rgdc is beefy rice over their dry food our trio made it perfectly clear that this was absolutely the best food they have ever had even better than the pork pasta that they loved noses buried in their bowls tails wagging while they ate and not a drop or morsel left behind now i am notified early every morning by sturgis that it is time to get up and make breakfast and in the afternoon he does the same thing emdd makes us dizzy with her spinning i am so happy dance and bobette simply hops around which for her very low key self is almost as strenuous as kick boxing meals vanish in record time bravo to rgdc for bringing delicious back to dog bowls ,1
of all the brands of licorice this one is the best always soft and they do fill you up ,1
i love this item for keurig coffee makers its delicious and i would definately order from this seller again i would like to try other flavors from the same seller ,1

i have looked for acacia powder in stores to no avail i have found it on a few websites but always sold in huge quantities at a large price this bottle is the perfect size if you are wanting to make gomme syrup for authentic mixed cocktails a dacquari made from scratch with gomme syrup over ice too die for im a fan ,1
if you squish together dates bananas mix in finely chopped almonds form into bars and dry the bars a bit so they are not too sticky you basically have a banana cookie larabar i think they taste quite good for packaged bars and are healthier than most of the available food bars they taste like well bananas dates and almonds with the almonds providing a bit of crunch although the ingredient list is only three words long the wrapper text extolling the healthfulness and near magical virtues of the bar is seven lines long to partially quote real food raw food no chemicals no fillers no medicinal tasting supplements larabar is never cooked never processed will leave you with a pleasing sense of vitality and well being for hours to come and there is more information on the wrapper uncooked unprocessed no added sugar non gmo gluten free dairy free soy free vegan kosher the larabar website also tells you in case you have not figured this out non irradiated no sulfites and no colorings all this is well and good but if they are going to the trouble of making a bar that is so fabulously healthy for you then it would be nice if they used organic ingredients eating a bar made with conventionally grown pesticided fruit invalidates some of the healthfulness of the bar the bar tastes good but in terms of healthfulness i think larabar can do better p s and what is with the two dots above the first letter a in lara do they want us to think it is an exotically scandinavian product like haagen daz lara bars are made in the u s a ,1
a quick tasty satisfying stew pop it open microwave seconds serve withbuttered bread or oyster or saltine crackers ,1

well i cooked it with some chicken breast and i also added some potatoes carrots garlic and onions it tasted good but not as good as some of the previous reviews have put it the sauce is just not thick enough maybe i add too much ingredient i do not know the smell was actually better than the taste but still it is a good product with very reasonal price it is easy to cook and it is healthy i guess also the shipping was fast i would purchase it again probably according to the reviews the butter chicken flavor seems to receive more praise than this one maybe i will try that next time ,1

ok all you little buckaroos out there gather round the stove for a little bit of texas traditional chili on the go is it as good as you have ever had well if you have had lots of chili and both home made and canned varieties probably not if you have had only canned varieties then maybe it is i have had a lot of chili in the day and of course nothing in a can is going to beat a pot of honest to gosh down home made goodness in a pot but for a quick and easy version wbc is about as good as i have ever seen it i am not going down that beans or no beans debate road since everything is subjective in that regard but if you just want a quick bowl of chili and you can hot rod it if you like with fresh tomato chunks sauteed onions etc then here is your guy used to be made in corsicana texas south of dallas not sure these days with some crackers and some good cheese slices you got yourself a nice little lunch going on there you can always shop around and sometimes find these going for about a buck a can just before fall tailgating weather hits in the meantime enjoy whenever you feel like it ,1

we got one of these in large size for our australian cattle dog mix and he loves it we use it each night sometimes in combo with other similar products to feed him his dinner the cube can hold a full cup of kibble it is entertaining to watch him herd it all over the den and it keeps him busy while we prepare or eat our own supper i agree with the earlier comment about the settings being easy and slightly less easy i wish it were a little more challenging but it is still a great toy ,1
loved this product it tastes so good this juice is very difficult to find but once you do you will not be dissappointed ,1

due to busy schedules sometimes we just need something quick for dinner that does not require much thought this is definitely one of the better wheat free gluten free boxed dinners out there and i actually look forward to eating it it is a little too salty in my opinion but i do not season the chicken or veggies i add and that seems to cut the salt a bit it is definitely quick and easy and tasty too i will buy again ,1
i tasted this product and all i can say is yecch i am normally the type who loves a cold cappuccino drink whether i get it from the store or at one of the local coffee shops but illy issimo is cappuccino coffee drink had a bitter metallic taste that i have never experienced in other store bought cappuccinos it might be just me but i would strongly suggest that in the future the makers of this drink rework the mixture and find some way to treat the cans so that this product does not come out with a metallic bitter flavor such as what i experienced when i drank it ,0
i ordered a box of these cookies to be sent to my mother who is years old they were her christmas present along with a box of the chocolate chunk breakfast cookies she does not eat breakfast so i thought these might encourage her to eat something in the morning with her meds she said they are really quite tasty she lives out of town and since i have to eat gluten free of course i have not personally tasted them but if my mother says they are good i feel confident in giving them a favorable review ,1
i am kind of an amateur when it comes to tea but i have tried several kinds of oolong tea mostly because of the supposed visceral fat burning benefits i can not really comment on the fat burning because i am also dieting and exercising but i can comment on the flavor of the tea i use one tea bag in an insulated mug of about ounces add a heaping teaspoon of splenda and leave it in the mug as i drink it over two to three hours probably not the best way to drink tea i know nevertheless this tea has a good moderately strong pleasant flavor holds its flavor and does not have a bitter aftertaste like some of the others i have tried best of all this was very economical for a hundred bags and eligible for free prime shipping i highly recommend this tea and plan to buy it again do watch to make certain it is specifically this brand and kind since foojoy has several that sound similar and i have tried one of the others that i did not like as well ,1

in proportion this drink is about equal to a regular soda in calories and sugar content but i would prefer a regular soda than this stuff there is a slight citrus taste but mainly from acidity and a horrible after taste of metal and sickly sweetness that lingers for several minutes after wards soda water with natural juice should be a refreshing pleasant and nice refreshment but none of these traits are in this drink i would be embarrassed to serve this beverage to anyone i liked for any occasion but would consider giving it to people i really did not care for to see their reaction avoid this one orange crush or a different orange soda diluted with soda water would taste far better or soda water and regular orange juice would also be a treat that puts this nasty stuff to shame ,0
bottom line these crackers are a great snack ordering by the case saves some money compared to the charged locally whether plain onion or sesame i have never tried the wasabi these are a low fat reasonable calorie snack eaten either plain or with something on it the only sad thing is that i first ordered them in for per case ,1

these things are pretty good i saw them in the store bought some there and then bought some online to save a few bucks they are kinda pricy but i tried to make them myself thinking it would be pretty easy since its just dried yams and mine did not come out as chewy or with the same texture my dog will eat it either way whether i made them or if i buy them and still love them as much but it takes a realy long time in the oven and i can not be bothered to wait my dog loves these things but then again she loves just about anything edible oh also my product came ontime ,1

i cook a lot of thai dishes mostly curry and soups i use a lot of coconut milk in them usually more than a traditional recipe might call for over the years i have experimented with different brands and this one is not only my favorite but often much cheaper than some of the competing brands all good quality coconut milks will cook up the same more or less what makes chaokoh my favorite is that it usually has the most solids aka cream per can which is the secret to having a rich thicker curry without resorting to extra starch be sure you store the cans the way you received them upside down or right side up and always open from the top of the can as that will make it much easier to get all the cream out with the liquid rather than having to try and scrape it from the bottom or opening both ends very creamy with no grit or chunks great real coconut flavor a must for any thai cooking at home yes i have had a few dented cans too but really what is the problem use of a good can opener always gets them open and a dent has never changed the quality of the contents in my experience ,1

caffeine wires me so for many years i avoided coffee i wanted the stimulation a cup of coffee provides but wanted a convenient way to brew it i found the folgers single servings and they were perfect but i had to start either limiting my coffee intake or brew decaf instead the folgers decaf single servings are perfect just heat the water and let it brew i let it seep for a couple of minutes which is much longer than folgers suggests but i like my coffee strong these things are the ultimate in convenience a single serving in a neat little packet and it is a great cup of coffee when i travel i pack enough to get me through the trip much better than that awful stuff you can make in room jerry,1

it works as well as agar in bar form and the price is good i do however recommend you use half the recommended amount so more like tablespoon to pint of liquid versus tablespoons but you might have to experiment and it will depend on the liquid but tablespoons i find will make it too stiff ,1
this is the most bland boring sauce i have had the misfortune to encounter it is not the salt though certainly that is a piece of the puzzle but the sauce itself tastes very watered down and with just a hint of any spice and the only spice to taste is a little bit of pepper that is it it distinctly lacks in any sort of flavor indian flood is very flavorful usually so that pretty much makes this one a pass completely do not bother find a good indian recipe on the net and make your own or find a good indian buffet ,0
we have a keurig coffee maker one of the side benefits is the opportunity to experiment with different k cups i have already tried half a score some seem pretty tasty at first until one taste something that is even better some early k cups that i graded highly do not compare too well with later brands that i have tried wolfgang puck is columbian dark roast noir is one of the better products that i have tried it has a bold taste although not strongly so it is also smooth tasting it is now on my short list of possibilities for my first morning cup of coffee so i am pretty happy with wolfgang puck is product here ,1

bought this recently and will not purchase again for someone who likes strong coffe this did not do it for me ,0
for an everyday family cook these are excellent salts the sampler looks so cool i was reluctant to use it lol but the novice chef in me could not wait to try them in my meals simply amazing if you are an amateur like me wanting to try something different than the ordinary stuff you usually cook then these samplers are an awesome way to start ,1
i like that these come in different colors to make things more interesting for babies they are crunchier than the happybaby brand which i like they are a little sweeter too which could be good or bad depending on your baby is or your taste one downside is that the purple color dusting does rub off on wet sticky fingers and can temporarily stain clothes furniture ,1

my dogs sniffed these chews and then left them ignored on the floor for the next week finally i picked them up and since they had not been chewed i figured i would pass the bag to a friend rather than waste them since my dogs would not chew them i cannot recommend them my dogs are not very fussy with chews i am unsure why they lack appeal for my dogs but having them lay on the floor so long there is definitely a lack of flavor or scent they are not inexpensive either i am sorry that my dogs could not give them a second chance ,0

the caffe lungo capsules produce one of the best americanos i have ever had the flavor is as deep and rich as my former espresso machine made in fact i am pretty sure it is better i was quite surprised at the quality and could drink this everyday the amount of crema also exceeded what the senseo produces by a significant amount i also felt very satisfied after one cup of this although i normally drink a couple of cups of coffee in the morning for around cents a cup i would much rather have this than starbucks any day although nescafe does not have nearly enough varieties of coffee for their dolce gusto this one is a winner ,1
casseroles for dogs that is right our dogs really do enjoy these our little chihuahuas are picky eaters i really do not find canned foods helpful since they will not eat any that has been put in the refrigerator overnight these are perfect because we can split a single package and mix it in with the kibble even better when we travel these are easy to open and carry ,1

appian way pizza is a family tradition in our house my mother in law introduced us to it the crust is not what sets this pizza mix apart it is the sauce the sauce is amazing in order to get the pizza to stretch out nicely and be much easier to work with use boxes it makes a heartier pizza that stretches to any cookie sheet another trick is to make the dough as directed using two boxes then soak a dish towel in hot water wring the towel out until its damp set on top of the bowl and place in the oven for at least an hour the dough will fit on a large cookie sheet and stretch nicely ,1
i have been making the switch to whole grains over the last few months the hardest part by far has been rice i love rice i could eat it at every meal i make fried rice serve it with meats mix it in soups etc most brown rice i have had has been a sticky clumpy mess hardly a substitute for the jasmine long grain rice which i adore thankfully a friend of mine recommended lundberg rice and this is the first variety i tried i was a little skeptical looking at the package and even more so once i started cooking the rice it smelled very nice as it cooked though i mixed in a teaspoon of butter and a little garlic and herbs and served it alongside some grilled salmon after a few bites my initial concerns melted away this was easily some of the tastiest rice i have ever had white or otherwise i loved every bite of it i could not believe how good it was actually i am so so happy to have found a brown rice that is a substantive replacement for all of the nutrition less carbs that are in white rice i plan to use this rice for most of the applications where i would have used white rice but still treat myself to some fried rice made with white rice once in a while flavor texture and nutrition are all aligned with this wild blend i would recommend it to anyone who loves rice white or otherwise ,1
i love this product i went vegan a couple years ago for many reasons but mostly to help combat high cholesterol after only a few months my cholesterol was lower by almost and i never had to stop eating delicious baked goods i have used this in pancakes breads cookies muffins brownies and no one can tell the difference for the person who had bad results with a boxed betty crocker recipe maybe making them from scrach would yield better results and would probably be healthier too i have never had a problem with something not setting up oh yeah and my sons favorite thing you can eat the batter and i do not have to worry about salmonella also eggs expire so fast this product has a year shelf life and are more costly one box of this is equivalent to eggs ,1
first if i could have rated this zero stars i would havi would like to say i am a regular eater of protein bars this is nothing like that rather a cut down version of a crunchy candy bar it is extremely small it did not even fill the modest size package that is was wrapped in approx of the size of a usual bar it is thin as well as short extremely sweet and modest crunch it might only measure calories but most of those come from simple sugar the first ingredients are sugar so if you want a sugar high fine but if your are looking for a healthy low cal mid meal snack that is healthy find another bar there are loads of them out there so inconclusion this is a cut down candy bar faking it as a healthy low calorie item kellogg you can do way better than this ,0
i got these for my girlfriend because she loves twizzlers i think she enjoyed them being larger because she can justify just having one or two and still getting twice as much candy they are about longer than a normal one so not quite double length there are no other differences makes a good gift ,1

we have always just gone with the regular pimiento stuffed olives and tried this on a whim we like olives and we like chorizo combined it was be good and it definitely was granted you can not really discern the chorizo taste on its own but something about the combination of the two just makes it delicious we eat it on its own or sliced up to top a salad or in recipes that calls for olives either way it is good ,1
tully is breakfast brew in my opinion is the best coffee available for the price i drink two to three cups every morning and it is a great way to start the day ,1

i would seen kraft mio liquid water enhancers in supermarkets near kraft crystal light and similar powdered beverage mixes but did not try it until receiving a sample container of the sweet tea flavor while i have long known that it is supposed to be good to drink glasses of water a day and apparently it is e g see anahad o connor is ny times article titled really the claim drink eight glasses of water a day to protect the kidneys it was not until my daughter emphasized and re emphasized this to me and encouraged me to use crystal light if necessary for taste that i began to really make it a point to drink that much water daily now that i have tasted mio i will definitely use that to flavor water as well i wish i would known about mio before recently being on the road for weeks because it would have been so convenient i can also see using it in eating establishments to flavor water instead of drinking plain water or using a sweetener and a lemon wedge if available to flavor the water the mio container easily fits in a purse pack or pocket i tested the sample container i received for leakage by shaking it vigorously when closed then carrying it in a winter jacket pocket where i carry keys and sometimes an eyeglasses case for a day of activity including driving and there was no leakage at all mio needs no refrigeration but kraft recommends that open containers be consumed within days after being opened at present mio comes in six flavors none of which contain caffeine or sugar or have calories and kraft says they plan to introduce more the other flavors in addition to the sweet tea are berry pomegranate fruit punch mango peach peach tea and strawberry watermelon i think i will try berry pomegranate next ,1
this is a hearty stand alone soup that makes a complete meal though it is still more delicious with hearty ploughman is bread on the side of course you can always slice in polish sausage or cooked italian sausage and it feeds many more hungry mouths ,1
my husband is gluten sensitive dairy sensitive and diabetic and he has a sweet tooth we were thrilled to find that these candies are allowed with all of his eating issues plus they are good thanks to amazon for carrying them ,1
our whole house is gluten free due to kids with celiac gluten allergies this is a great pancake mix we took several boxes with us on vacation and the cooked pancakes held up well for on the go snacks i also hosted christmas brunch for my husband is family and served these pancakes as part of the spread everyone loved them and came back for seconds they did not even mind that they were gluten free they kind of taste like jiffy blueberry muffins without the blueberries i make the entire box at one time and save any leftovers in the fridge or freezer these pancakes are fluffy pamela is mix pancakes are very thin my kids like them both but these have the consistancy and look of traditional gluten pancakes they also smell sweet like vanilla when cooking ,1
this is the only coffee mom liked from the sample packs that came with the keurig coffee brewer i gave her for christmas two years ago it is impossible to find in retail stores so i have ordered on line from another source for the past two years thank you amazon com for adding this to your product line and for the always great delivery service mom is happy ,1
these bars rock we first purchase them singly whole foods and enjoyed them so much we decided to buy them in bulk from amazon they have a few different flavors and all of them are great these are extremely filling even more so if you smear peanut butter on them for added protein great breakfast snack or even having just half a bar for dessert love these ,1
not only do these bring back memories but as i have gotten older i have realized that they not only have that great cinnamon taste but that they are actually useful after all they are toothpicks not only are they great for a last minute touch up before going out in public getting stubborn pieces of food from between the teeth but they sweeten the breath they are far above the average run of the mill toothpick back in high school they were used by some of my friends as weight loss aids spicy but with no calories also there was the added allure of mild risk courting the disapproval of adults they were actually banned in my school probably by fearful administators who had visions of kids falling while running and getting injured by the sharp points parents cautioned us not to drive with one of those in your mouth they were right but we did anyway hey we were teens but i digress this is one time when taking a trip down memory lane is worth the price ,1
i used to use karma organic dog food but had much difficulty in finding it so i switched to this product i have mid sized dogs ranging in age from years to years all seem to do well on this food and it seems to have more organic ingredients than others i have researched with the auto delivery program the price is something i can afford ,1

i ordered the box of bones for the first time and i am happy with the purchase so far my dog is small but a ferocious chewer and supervised pressed rawhides are the only way i can afford to sate that desire amazon has the best prices i have seen anywhere i do think i underestimated how small the actually are they are not bad but for the next purchase i may opt for the which are currently slightly cheaper on a per pound basis i ordered my bones direct from amazon based on one of the reviews the first thing i did was count the pieces there were exactly in the box as seen in the product photo the ranch rewards box has a large opening before shipping it amazon places it into another much more secure box perhaps some of the third party merchants take less care ,1

how do you review a dog food that you are not even going to taste yourself being scientifically accurate i brought four dogs to the figurative table two rat terriers riley and hawk a doberman halle and a brown lab polo for testing purposes i really i did set out four bowls my idea was to let each of them take a choice of the four beneful by purina chef michael is this product kirkland lamb rice their regular food and strangely enough dry cat food which seems to be a hit with all of them they obsess over it each dog had a turn i am not sure if it was the look of it because it looks like a real pot roast dinner but this product got woofed down the fastest they did not even look at the others i do not think dogs see in color so am convinced it was not the colorful kibbles my testing problem was that trying to take each dog away and put them aside to let the other dogs have a turn at the taste test was fraught with danger they did not want to give it up the kirkland and the beneful did not warrant any interest even when chef michael is was gone and those were the only options even the cat food that they usually go for probably just to get on the cat is nerves sat unnibbled so easy to say this was a hit small dog and big none had trouble with the size of the food it sort of looks like chunky stew without the liquid also a side bonus was that the gassy little rat terriers did not seem so gassy after although this bag only allowed them four dinners between the four dogs now that it is gone they are sad if i could afford this regularly i would purchase it there was no waste nothing for the blue jays to hit on the next day and an unexpected treat is that when you order dog food online if it is prime shipping it shows up quick and shipped free so no lugging it from the store i like that convenience of that and plan on putting dog food on a subscription plan on amazon so that i do not have to run out when when we frequently run out plus i get tired of running to costco for what i am told is quality food ,1
but frankly i do not get much of a buzz from any of the coca products they are quite expensive as compared to regular tea and make for a great change up but caffeine offers the user a far superior pick me up than what you can get from the coca leaf teas in my opinion as i said the taste is very original and one you will appreciate i think the only issue is how much one cares to pay for its novelty ,1
lemme tell you before this miracle drink i could not please my wife for more that sec is without me tiring out i mean after seeing her fat tail everyday i started to get limp in the spirit that is and then my friend bill you know bill from those commercials showed me this and let me tell you never has my wife been so happy not only can i please her for a whole second is but now i can please her for five hours at first she was just a fat repulsive whale who lost her charms and pizazz now after taking hour energy i can take on any challenge including my wife and my next door is neighbors wife not only has if kept me great with my wife i also can now power my car off on the sheer energy that radiates from my body for hours i was on a town rampage robbing banks hitting the gentlemen is clubs spray painting my obscene terms on corporate buildings you know the usual teenager stuff yeah my life has been great since i started taking this miracle drink the ladies love me the me envy me yeah i am the talk of the town now i even grew extra hair on my chest and my cabbages are too huge for my size pants now i have to move up to is pros keeps you up and going makes you the talk of the town makes you feel like you mean something again fends off mid life crisis for more hourscons you may wake up with bullet wounds you black out and wake back up to your face on the news for some reason your wife will not be able to walk for a month,1

my husband and i are addicted to these lollipops some will love them and some will not eat a couple of suckers and then decide the taste is different so it may take a time or two to really decide we eat one or two almost every day ,1
i have tried many different brands of spanish rice including goya and this is the best i can not find in the grocery stores where i live md even though the stores carry every other packaged mahatma product that is why i try to remember to get some whenever i order something through amazon ,1
at first i was not sure but i figured at the price i would give it a try i was pleasantly surprised at the flavor and quality of this coffee the k cup design is somewhat different and you will need to storethe coffee in a zip lock bag after opening the bag containing thecoffee other than that it is quality coffee at a very nice price we are talking each rather than each you can not beat it i am now buying the count and enjoying it even more asthe price is now each try it you will like it ,1

the bars taste very gingery and are unnecessarily way too sweet at least for me i bought them because of the coffee and chocolate content but could only taste ginger will have to throw them away as my husband will not eat them eather ,0

gerber does not use bpa in their inner packaging it is on the outside but it does not come in contact with the food good product yummy with a little butter and brown sugar heated up on the stove ,1
got this withing a couple days of ordering and they taste so fresh and good so glad to have discovered this superfood put them in my green smoothies and on my salads and even eat it a teaspoon of them when i feel hungry wish it was more readily available in the us ,1
good prompt service my only problem one that i took care of myself was that one of the sugar bags seemed to have a box blade cut on the package causing some of the sugar to be spilled into the shipping container since there was not a huge amount missing from the bag i simply transfered the contents to a sealable bag of my own i thought it better to do that than try shipping the item one single piece back otherwise i am completely happy with my purchase ,1
these cherries are really delicious they are almost addictive i will definetly buy more when these run out they are plump and sweet and wonderful ,1

however this is not authentic southern sweet it can be if you add tablespoons or more of granulated sugar to each ounce cup you brew then it comes close to sweet like southern sweet tea is sweet the tea taste is great at the ounce brew level but there is no way to get enough sugar in a k cup ,1
while looking for a distinctive heart healthy rice i discovered lundberg wild blend a delicious combination of wild and whole grain brown rice yes it takes longer to cook averaging minutes than the popular nanosecond microwave white variety but it is so much better for you a fraction of the starch and glucose of the others lundberg is is not only healthier but it is tasty too and complements many main dishes like no other try it ,1
i have two cats they have eaten purina one for six years now their coats are shiny and they both look healthy and have lots of energy they are both eleven years old i started feeding them purina one because the first ingredient on the label was chicken there are also no artificial colors or flavors and unlike some pet foods it is manufactured in the united states those are enough reasons for me to choose this particular food i think that even though purina one is not the best of the best of cat foods it is a good value for the price and the cats love it my male kitty will not eat anything else a tip for anyone just introducing a new food to your kitty introduce the food slowly by mixing just a little of the new food with the old food increase the amount each time you feed the kitty eventually eliminating the quantity of the previous food this will help to alleviate any stomach upset that your kitty may experience from a new food ,1
i love coconut juice and thought wow it will be so much cheaper this way nope because you are not going to drink it it tastes awful chalky no coconut flavor and warm as opposed to real coconut juice refrigerated at the same temperature is really cold do not buy this it is a good idea that it seems they did not try themselves before going full scale gross ,0
we are told that dark chocolate contains a healthful type of oil some nutritionists saying that one half ounce per day can be beneficial for one is blood pressure without adding much at all to total caloric intake what a good thing that something this tasty can be good for us ,1
they have changed this recipe and it does not taste the same anymore the last time i order it was a little different but i could still drink it now it is not the same at all and i am so disappointed it is not even drinkable i am going to contact the company to see if they can do anything ,0
when it comes to chai tea this celestial seasonings chai decaf tea sweet coconut thai is my favorite i really love the indian and thai fusion of flavors in this tea a perfect combination i must say i like the coconut taste in this tea and when it comes to thai inspired at home teas this celestial seasonings sweet coconut chai definitely tastes better than yogi tea is sweet thai delight tea it is also a bonus that this tea is decaffeinated and as the other amazon reviewers have said this tea is definitely perfect for relaxation and before going to bed if you like thai inspired teas such as this i also suggest trying harney and sons bangkok green tea with thai flavors it is an excellent delicious fine tea with coconut vanilla ginger and lemongrass i also highly recommend the coffee bean and tea leaf is thai picked lemon chamomile blueberry peach green tea and spring peach oolong teas another tea with some thai influence is the fairmont hotels and resorts organic berry berry caffeine free tea for cold thai teas i highly recommend taste nirvana is real thai tea latte and real green tea latte my parents were born and raised in thailand and thus i am thai american if you actually visit thailand which i have multiple times since the majority of my relatives live there then i highly recommend trying thai chrysanthemum tea i had the best tea i have ever had in my entire life in thailand and that is saying something because i have actually traveled up sometimes my small traveling party and i had to walk a long and grueling hike for intervals of minutes to a whole hour even actor blair underwood made a comment how he was amazed that even elderly chinese women could climb up these mountains for long periods of time and claimed they were in better shape than him that is how i felt as well if you visit china you will see that a lot of chinese are very physically fit they walk hike bike a lot and do all sorts of exercises such as swimming and tai chi and fan exercises in their parks the tea growing terraced mountains in and around the guilin region of china and tasted tea from those chinese regions and also tasted some tea when i traveled to japan but those asian teas do not compare to the chrysanthemum tea i had many years back in northern thailand i have not traveled to england and india yet but would love to i bet the teas there are amazing but like i said from all the countries i have traveled to so far thailand has the best teas cold and hot when i think about it i was very young then and i should have asked the thai waitress where they got their tea from all i know is that i drank that tea at a restaurant at a thai hotel resort many years back in northern thailand not far from chiang rai and the golden triangle region anyways i have given boxes of this celestial seasonings sweet coconut thai chai decaf tea as small gifts to friends in the past few years the fact that you can order this in packs of six at an affordable price is great and allows you the luxury to share some of this tea with friends and family my verdict is that this is a nice aromatic delicious tea to unwind for the day ,1
each jar makes quarts or gallons and costs or per jar so this comes out to per gallon crystal light makes a similar tea mix in tubes of pre measured little tubs ,1

this product controls your appetite and tastes delicious great flavor makes drinking water enjoyable ,1
bought quite a number of these i had not realized that by buying in bulk i would end up with filters at my disposal i do not like the fact that they will last at least years or more i do not like to think that far ahead where coffee filters are concerned specially since now i will have to make sure that whatever coffee maker we use it will require to have number cone filters or else find out which of my neighbors use the same size and surprise them with an unexpected gift for we are not at all close that aside they do the job really well fit just fine and it looks like the brewing season will go uninterruptedly for quite some time i have to slow down between costco and amazon all this buying on bulk is getting to me i probably could have went to a local place and purchase one or two of these melitta cone coffee filters perhaps in white or like i just did in brown now that the deed is done with no more anxieties on my part regarding enough coffee filters i give melitta cone coffee filters natural brown no count pack of a solid stars ,1
we ordered this to make key lime pie martini is and it is excellent i have found other recipes that call for key lime juice and am relieved to always have something on hand now we orderd bottles and will order more when this supply is gone ,1
i am a bbq chip fanatic and have tried every chip in almost every state these are in the top ten crisp real potato flavor taste home made the only suggestion is they could add a little more of the bbq flavoring that would move them up to the top category and at this price they can not be beat thank you route your little slice of heaven,1
this is a product that makes you have to share with your friends i am almost out so this is my newest expensive habit ,1

this spicy vinegar sauce is perfect on any cooked greens or green beans you can add it to soup for a little kick too i grew up eating it as a kid but my local grocery stores do not carry this item anymore i am so happy we could have it once again thanks to amazon com ,1
so far we had orders of this organic medjool dates and we are planning on frequent ordering the quality and price are much better than nearby stores ,1
this tea is so awesome perfect blend of cinnamon and orange in black tea i had gotten some from my daughter in law for christmas one year she lives in seattle so everytime i went back i bought at least boxes i drink it everyday yes even in our hundred degree weather in phoenix i was so excited when i found it on amazon so now i order it bags at a time i store some in a glass jar in the refrigerator and the rest in the freezer bring it out for guests they will love it and sit down and enjoy a cup for yourself ,1
i love this product smells so good first thing in the morning i use teaspoons in a cup like it stronger very good with creamer or milk i have to have my cream that is just me ,1
decided to try a small bottle from the store once i blew through it in less than a week i decided to go ahead get the amazon deal my husband i drink coffee everyday this syrup the caramel are fabulous for flavoring coffee one those days when you want to feel fancy pampered i was afraid the artificial sweetener would give it a chemical aftertaste but not at all it is an inexpensive luxury both in cash calories ,1
i was very pleased with how fast i received my order thank you thomas r templin,1
love this coffee but it has gotten too expensive the coffee is smooth and full of flavor the only problem is that i need to buy it in spurts when i have extra money ,1
ghirardelli had been my standby for xmas candy making since it was the only brand left i could find in my town that made actual white chocolate chips but this year they like everyone else seem to think that no one will notice the difference if they take out the actual y know chocolate part believe me manufacturers we can tell the difference so this year since i could not find any white chocolate chips i just went with the nestle is since if ghirardelli is making the same inferior product i might as well go with the cheaper option right well i should have just given up on using white coatings on anything because this stuff is utter crap i actually do not think it tastes all that bad it tastes like the coating on a zero bar basically but if i am making homemade candy it is not supposed to taste like a cheap commercial candy bar it is supposed to taste like good quality homemade candy more important than this though is the fact that they did not even melt and i could not use them i followed the directions precisely but i kept stirring and heating in tiny increments and they just would not melt and then finally i guess they seized or something because i was left with an unusable lump of half melted weirdly hardened white chips i never ever had this problem with actual white chocolate before and i have been using it for years and years this was a complete waste of my money ugh give us back our actual white chocolate candy manufacturers we do know the difference we will pay a little more for the real thing if you would just give us the option of doing so ,0
just received these boxes rather than buying the bar type that i did before excellent they are small bite size pieces that are soft and flavorful really fresh i did the subscribe and save and am happy that i did my husband and i really enjoy this brand the boxes are larger than i realized but i still will carry this item in my purse for a pick me up and to have a handy snack available with me the boxes have a open and close tab with a plastic seal over the product once you open the box i can not find one bad thing to say no dissapointments at all ,1
mostly water and not a chunk to be found this is shameful about enough tuna mush in a can to make one small sandwich as i understand it sams club guarantees satisfaction for this product the remainder is going back next trip ,0
i just made this and it was quite good i added sweet onions and mushrooms which really added depth to the dish i am sure this would taste great plain as well i am going to experiment with more vegetables in the future it was a bit more spicy than the butter chicken paste i tasted some saffron and ginger and perhaps a kick of red pepper try making some homemade naan bread to go along with it ,1
i was surprised by the strong ginger kick i have tried many ginger teas and have been disappointed many times but not by this this is far superior to the varieties of ginger tea in bags that i have tried i do not notice a specific turmeric flavor but that may be because i have a spice heavy diet so it is too subtle for my tastebuds to pick up and i love a good bite to many foods and drinks so far i have only tried it hot but plan on making an iced tea version soon i will definitely be ordering this on a regular basis ,1
i love hot chocolate so when my wife got a keurig i had to try the hot chocolate boy was it awful the chocolate taste was so weak i had to add a good scoop of swiss miss to make it drinkable there was also a taste of plastic i think the k cup gets so hot it actually melts the cup a little ,0
okay i think this is a great idea super concentrated drink liquidin a nice tiny bottle that you can customize the stregnth by how much you add to the water the main gripe i have is with the taste way to fakey in my opinion does nt taste exactly like brewed sweet tea to my taste buds it is not horrible just no the greatest either i guess i do got to remember this is a concentrate and not the real thing i love real tea iced sweet and hot so i guess i will be sticking with my good ol tea bags some will like this stuff i for one did nt care that much for it,0
if you have read my other recommendations i really love this company eden foods they really care about selling pure and clean foods and are a trustworthy company anyhow i am also really into organics and tried out every single toasted sesame oil out there i was disappointed in all of them because none of them had the same asian flavor that i was used to for toasted sesame oil then i tried the eden foods brand and fell in love it tastes exactly how it should taste and has so much flavor instead of the bland ones like the one from spectrum or napa valley if you read up on the company they do business with japanese companies that have been producing these food items the traditional way and hence the great flavor i know it seems expensive for that tiny bottle but once you try this sesame oil you will not go back try mixing it with some soy sauce and rice and throwing in a mix of vegetables tastes wonderful ,1
my dogs like this treat pretty well they are a little on the dry side but i have bought other treats that were also dry and they seem to like these better i would buy them again ,1
i am reluctant to share all the recipes of things we are using bob is red mill potato flour for why because they are so good once people try them it might start selling out oh what the heck you talked me into it i will share a couple of them anyway for delicious gluten grain free chicken nuggets start with a pound of skinless boneless chicken cut into nugget sized pieces we use dark meat because it comes out moister and more flavorful pat the pieces with a paper towel to remove excess moisture next combine the following in a quart size zip lock bag you can adjust the seasonings to your own taste of cup plus tbsp bob is red mill potato tsp tsp onion tsp garlic tsp tsp white or black tsp dried parsley flakes crushed to powderput half the chicken pieces in the bag zip it closed and toss gently to coat the chicken remove the chicken pieces shaking off the excess coating back into the bag and cook them in a little oil in a nonstick skillet over medium low heat it is important to cook over medium low heat like that because potato flour can scorch using tongs or a fork turn the pieces occasionally until lightly browned and cooked through repeat with the remaining chicken pieces once you try chicken made with potato flour like this you may never want chicken made with wheat flour again for a quick and easy dairy free gluten free tapioca like pudding yes pudding bring cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan add a pinch of salt and tsp baking soda to the water the baking soda will neutralize the potato tang of potato flour add a generous dash of vanilla extract in a small bowl use a fork to stir together a quarter cup plus tbsps of white sugar and a quarter cup plus tbsp of bob is red mill potato flour remove the saucepan from the heat this is important you do not want the thickening mixture to boil and spatter on you gradually pour the dry ingredients from the bowl into the hot water stirring the water with a fork to mix while you do the mixture will thicken instantly no matter how much you stir there will be some lumps so if you do not like lumps either do not bother with this recipe or take an extra step of pushing the mixture through a sieve allow the pudding to cool we usually hasten that process by placing the saucepan in a sink half filled with cold water we also use potato flour as an extender for wheat free meat loaf and as an extender and coating for chicken fried steak cook in a skillet with a little oil over medium low heat so the potato flour does not scorch we also okay i am not going to tell you any more i have said too much already now do not go buying up all my bob is red mill potato flour ,1
if you are looking for an upgrade from the standard tazo or lipton bagged green tea this is the way to go by far the best bagged green tea i have ever tried you will not regret buying this ,1
after work out i make a honey tea putting one table spoon in a warm water mixed with a teaspoon of creatine powder for the fast muscle recovery process this honey is so wonderful it tastes great and it brings out subtle and yet delightful scents of flowers i can almost imagine wondering through exotic flowers and whatnot in the rain forest and it is organic so you have a piece of mind knowing that it is pure and good for your body ,1
we absolutely love this salsa and will buy no other we use it to make guacamole by simply mixing with avocados it makes better guacamole than we can get in any restaurant around it is also simply great salsa for dipping with tortilla chips the fire roasted flavor is delicious we order it from amazon because it is almost a dollar a jar cheaper than our grocery store ,1
i have used a similar type of conditioner and it seems that they all have a coconut scent i do not like i have to use a tiny bit of product wash it out fully with water more than i would normally use yet the scent of the tropics still remains it does work the scent just lingers for days ,1
granola was very dry and not too sweet need milk i prefer costco is granola it taste much better i would not recommend the purchase of this product now i got to find way to get rid of the other packages also bought the fruit and nut one hope that is better ,0
i bought pounds bob is red mill does not have the occasional gritty and sandy shell specks like another brand coconut flour which is fairly mild in flavor is gluten free high fiber and high protein it naturally sweetens dishes even though it is low in carbohydrates glycemic load of zero i use this versatile fiber for smoothies pancakes muffins brownies and pizza crusts you can also use it to thicken soups and sauces because coconut flour lacks gluten you have to use many eggs to bind ingredients however i reduce the overpowering flavor of the eggs and increase the fat coconut oil and fluids because the flour absorbs large amounts of moisture and dries out the products blueberry coconut flour muffins taste great and mimic cornbread with a slightly fibrous texture whether you are eating low carb diabetic friendly gluten free or any other diet you can still use this versatile virtually non allergenic coconut flour to boost your fiber intake and add variety to your dishes my digestive system feels much better with all this coconut flour i just wish that it was sold in sacks ,1
i am not nearly as picky about the variety of flavors so i am not unhappy about the duplications when i first bought them i started with root beer watermelon orange oil and cotton candy i used too much and was not pleased with the flavor results what i have learned since use a dropper to measure the amount of flavoring use orange oil with only six drops per litre it was my error in the beginning that made the products seem bad root beer in particular is very bitter if you use too much i purchased these to use with my soda stream soda maker and sweat leaf stevia sweetener the vials seem small but they make quite a bit when you use them sparingly i now keep a dropper handy for measuring i am simply having a ball choosing what flavor of soda i am drinking for the day ,1
i can not say enough about orgain it is by far the best meal replacement protein shake i have tried and i have tried them all my husband and i each have at least one per day for breakfast and occasionally after a workout i have purchased orgain on subscribe and save for several months and have encouraged many others to do so as well they are delicious and convenient thank you orgain for delivering a superior product at a great price ,1
like all the other reviews state it is ridiculously hot however it is also typically used incorrectly whether it be on purpose or an accident personally if i accidentally got a giant glob of this on something i would just trash it and start over you seriously only need to put a couple drops just does not do it for me but a glob will leave you hurting to add the amazing flavor without killing your taste buds or yourself my family are a bunch of wimps when it comes to hot food i however really like it so i got a bottle of this after having tried some at a company lunch in chicago it is perfect if used properly recommend it for anyone that likes to add a kick with a good flavor along with the caution use it right do not try and impress anyone and you will be in heaven ,1
these are amazing very tasty which can be hard to find among whole wheat crackers just really wish they could also be organic ,1
original review off i love and use regularly other madhava products both light and dark regular agave syrups as well as coconut sugar i eat almost entirely organic foods and really needed a more affordable hazelnut flavoring for my coffee currently i am using flavorganics hazelnut which is exaclty the flavor i love but i was looking for something a little more affordable the taste is just off and it is not the agave i love both light and dark agave from madhava it has a chemical or artificial taste to it and i could not do more than two sips of coffee to tell i needed to get rid of the entire i am going to see if amazon will take them back even if i have to pay shipping because i think it is offensively bad the flavorganics has actual organic hazelnut extractives which taste like real hazelnuts like the ones in justin is hazelnut nut butter updated review notified amazon that i was extremely displeased with the quality of this product even though it is clearly not the fault of amazon nor their responsibility to ensure i am happy they went out of their way to make me an even happier customer than i normally am i mean we spend hundreds of dollars a month on amazon easily and i think it is one of the best companies in the world if we can not find it on amazon or at trader joe is then we probably do not need it i still think this product is terrible and i have always thought that the starred reviews should reflect only the quality of the product for better or worse however i figure the words of the review can stray from that requirement ,0
i have tried other brands of raw honey and they have alot of wax then honey in the jars but this brand you can taste the honey it does not leave a wax ring on your tea cup i will buy this brand again ,1
i love all things coconut and was first drawn to coconut sugar when i turned to a paleo lifestyle i love that it is an organic low glycemic sweetener the blonde variety can be used as a sub for either white or brown sugar i make everything from pancakes to muffins to cookies with this and recommend it to all of my friends looking to make a healthy easy swap for refined sugar in their pantry added bonus that palm coconut sugar does not clump up as much as traditional refined brown sugar ,1
seeing such great deals here for green mountain coffees i assumed they would have the best deal on my dark magic blend i love most of the come in packs with in a pack but the dark magic is clearly the exception it is way over priced here i can get an pack in target for but low and behold over at coffee cow a pack is much better deal ,0
the peas are not green like the photo on the package they do not taste like peas and the coating does not taste like wasabi all in all these are a failure ,0
for fun i went to the nutrition store tonight and bought about dozen different protein nutritio bars my daughter and i decided we would do a taste test of each one so that we could buy the ones we liked in bulk off amazon it was a rather expensive endeavour especially since we threw out over half of them after the first bite well as you might imagine there were quite a few blech bars virtually inedible there were maybe a handful of bars that we deemed edible if really hungry and there were no other healthy options and then there were about that were really really tasty the go raw live pumpkin bar is full of yummy crunchy nuttiness i loved the taste and texture of it just bursting with pumpkin seed flavor and lightly sweetened it has more calories than any other bar i tried but it also comes with of protein of fiber and of healthy fats it is the kind of bar that is going to leave you satisfied for a long time i will definitely get these again ,1
when this quinoa arrived i was so excited it was so large and light weight and the seller was so nice following up to ensure that it had arrived safely unfortunately i did not get around to using it right away first use it was super gritty despite rinsing like eating sand so the second time around i soaked it for minutes again gritty the and final time i soaked it an hour still gritty and mushy the remaining uncooked quinoa has been thrown away this is no reflection of the seller they were very thorough ,0
either mixed with hot water milk or a spoonful in your morning coffee it is very good ,1
i ordered these since one of my favorite recipes involves egg noodles and i have been unable to find them down here in mexico i could not believe the prices of some of the other noodles who pays for noodles anyway these are good and get the job done husband and i tested them a few nights ago and they had a good flavor i will buy them again ,1
this tea has a wonderful flavor at a reasonable price and it is organic to boot i am very happy with my purchase and will most certainly be ordering bulk tea from davidson is in future ,1
first of all let me be clear that i really like this product it is yummy and the price is good the reason for the one star rating is that i have been reordering it for quite a while i reorder from my shopping list so i do not read the description carefully since i am just re ordering exactly the same thing i have gotten before or so i thought this time the bottles were half the size but the price was the same i looked at an old bottle actually can and noted that it was oz this time the three cans were each oz now the description clearly says oz so i can not complain about that but it came off my shopping list which always before sent me three oz cans so bottom line is just be careful if you have ordered this in the past and be aware of what you are getting it is still a good value just not a killer deal as it was before ,0
i am eating this chocolate as part of trauma therapy large bars come with visualization exercises it is so delicious i love the idea of using chocolate to reduce anxiety and be more present i suggest the bacon dark chocolate bar scrumptious ,1
we have ordered this product two times and the gluten free bread is very good it is light and tasty and with small pieces of cheese makes and excellent appetizer ,1
addressing the other reviews about crushed and dented cans all the cans in my case were all in perfect shape i have only bought friskies cat food after most of the other high quality pet food companies got caught buying tainted chinese protein that caused a lot of dead pets my cats were safer buying friskies than the more expensive stuff sold at the vet and at the pet stores this cat food was new to two seven month old adopted strays since getting them home from the humane society they have shown an interest in canned cat food but nothing crazy this stuff stood out as very different though they completely emptied their bowls and begged for more they have not done that on any other type of canned food so i thought it was worth a mention ,1
i bought this tea last year directly from chartreuse and have been doling it out on special occasions i have tried other lemon rooibus mixes but this one has just the right balance refreshing both hot and cold i can understand why people drink it all day and i am going to start i am so glad amazon is carrying it now ,1
i am a big fan of lemon treats so i could not pass up trying a bag on my last trip to whole foods these are so good that i searched on amazon for them to my luck surprise not only found their delicious selves but signed up for the subscribe save once a month discounted deliveries oh yeah oh yum i am considering trying out their other cookies i just can not make up my mind which to pick however if they contain agave i will give them a pass these lemon cookies contain no agave sweetener just sprouted sesame seeds dates coconut lemon all organic raw nourishing goodness the way food should be the cookies are tiny crisp chewy you are forced to slow down when you eat them or you may end up with a tired jaw these need to be nibbled at if find you ate an entire bag it is not all bad the whole bag contains way less fat calories regular cookies ,1
home baked short bread doesnt get any easier than this just cream a stick of butter mix and press into whatever pan you have handy this is as good as the shortbread i ate while living in northern england ,1
i bought this for my dog since his skin gets dry in the winter time ,1
this product is becoming hard to find in local stores here in the seattle area i love the fact that i found it on amazon and for a price that beats all others hands down if you enjoy potato dumplings from germany these are the ones to get hint drop a beef bouillon cube in water where you cook the dumplings it adds a discreet yet delicious flavor to them ,1
this cereal packs a punch it has a tremendous amount of fiber yet tastes like a delicious regular cereal my and year old boys love it ,1
i really really really wanted to like this i like other things from this company and i love coconut water especially straight outta the nut no sweeteners needed i also like coconut manna and coconut smell and coconut milk shredded coconut etc this tastes nothing like coconut water i think the stuff they add to it is what ruins it it tastes salty and fake i wish they could would just dehydrate the coconut and powder it and package that maybe it would be different i love coconut water but do not feel comfortable with the environmental cost of shipping etc i was happy to find it in powdered form and happy that there were so few ingredients i really wanted to like this i am so bummed i can not even give it away i see it is out of stock maybe they are reformulating it big tree farms if you read this please improve the taste of your formulation and let us know when you have i will gladly update my review for an improved product i rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions i hope this review helped you too ,0
after reading the reviews i was a bit skeptical that these would be edible but after trying them i think the bad reviews are based on an unfair expectation that these are a replacement for wheat flour pasta these actually are a fairly good substitute for asian style glass noodles and work well in stir fry and soup dishes after rinsing i tossed them into a stir fry pan with various veggies some spices and a bit of soy sauce and except for the slightly tougher texture the dish came out tasting like noodle take out from our local chinese restaurant i would not think they would hold up as well in a traditional spaghetti style dish but when prepared with a thinner sauce and left to cook long enough to absorb the other flavors of the dish they can be quite tasty one of the most filling meals i have had since trying to watch my calorie intake ,1
this product is way too sweet i diluted with half milk and there are still chunks of sugar and it is syrupy sweet even my husband who enjoys spoonfuls of maple syrup thinks it is too sweet ,0
simply delicious the preparation is a bit involved and you will need to purchase some fresh ingrediants to make this mix but if done according to the directions the cupcakes are out of this world yummy ,1
i have tasted many different kinds of coconut water but this exceeds them all because it preserves the natural taste of coconut without being bitter or too sweet healthy delicious refreshing i am glad i discovered samui ,1
overall i like this new velveeta cheesy skillets meal it was very fast less than minutes including browning the meat and unlike hamburger helper the velveeta does not require milk so quite simple to make in a pinch if you have not been to the store or whatever and the noodles are larger than the ones in the hamburger helper version the only negative thing was a slight after taste for the first few bites it was sort of a chemical tinged flavor i was the only one of the three of us that had this for dinner that experienced that after taste sensation it is entirely possible that it is just me so i am only taking one star from the overall rating ,1
box is bent and all of the sticks are stuck together this is gift i will not be giving this the way it is please let me know if there is anything i can do ,0
i do not know what these other reviewers were drinking if you close your eyes it tastes just like cold spring water maybe it is mind over matter with them i tried the water for the health benefits which i do not really notice maybe that is mind over matter too anyway now that i find out it is a business venture of the jersey housewives i probably will not be buying any more sorry ,1
this is the first oolong tea that i have tasted i found it enjoyable with a mild and delicious flavor ,1
makes great iced tea for the spring and summer months very refreshing in a hurry no need to boil water i add tea bags to a qt container hot or room temperature water let it sit on the counter for awhile then refridgerate ,1
i should have read the prior reviews because they captured my opinion exaactly the gooy stuff inside one of the candies from a few years ago could supply a days production run today ,0
this is the second time we have ordered the bottle pack of mccormick imitation vanilla butter nut flavoring unbelievably delicious good to use in baking frosting whatever your imagination can come up with just remember a little bit goes a long way ,1
we typically will doctor the spice mix a little bit to make the jerky our own however this both alone or doctored is hands down the best tasting pepper mix i have ever had possible things to add when doctoring garlic powdercuminred currycelery salt,1
i got this kit for my college son for christmas as he and his girlfriend enjoy making meals of all kinds together it was impossible to find a simple kit locally and i was very happy with this product it came sooner than promised and had just about everything to start making sushi the only issue was the handbook was not as clear as it could be for a beginner so they watched some video is on youtube and as a result we all enjoyed some awesome sushi for new years i may order a kit for myself thanks,1
first off i would like to say i just tried this tea for the first time and i loved it the tea has a subtle flavor that is hard to describe it has a pleasant taste that is not to overwhelming but refreshing it gives you a boost after drinking it and leaves you feeling more alert and peaceful the goji berries have a slightly sweet and bitter flavor and taste like they were just picked i have always been impressed with yogi teas not only do they taste good but they are all very healthy and promote healing i would also like to add that the goji berry is one of the most healing fruits in traditional chinese medicine after i drink up my boxes of tea i will definitely order more this tea is percent organic made from a proprietary blend of green tea green matcha tea leaf and goji berries ,1
laffy taffy is the best always stays soft and chewy great flavors and the shipment was so easy now i have a enough for a party for the house and for lunches ,1
with a combination of citrus zest and spices mixed with black tea his tea has an excellent smell and taste the pleasant spicy aroma reminded me a bit of chai tea but the predominant flavor was simply the black tea it is loose tea so make sure you have a tea strainer or other brewer that you can use with loose tea this small tin will probably last you all through the holiday season ,1
i have been supplementing my show line german shepherds with olewo red beets since they were young olewo red beets provide great health benefits for my high energy dogs they stay fit and maintain a suitable weight people rave about their rich red and black coat colors i am happy to provide my dogs with a natural food supplement that is high in antioxidants ,1
horizon can always be counted on to supply good great milk products and from what i have heard about how they treat their animals it sounds like they do their part for the health and well being of the animal and the environment i do have two legitimate gripes with my purchase though first the price is a bit higher than it need be but ok i could have chosen not to order secondly the expiration date is not far off enough for this to truly provide you with a back up source of milk on hand my batch is only good for months of course i can use it within months but that was not necessarily the idea it was more intended to provide a red cross pantry type product for when we unexpectedly ran out or could not get to the store etc so i really wish they would extend the shelf life on the product they are shipping this is not the first time it has happened it happens on each order i have placed if amazon and horizon could collaborate and get a much more extended shelf life this would be even be worth the extra cost just to have the peace of mind but they really need to work on that aspect enjoy your milk ,1
i recently ordered the sour punch twists they arrived in perfect condition and taste fresh i would definitely use this seller again ,1
this is the best tea either hot or cold i am receiving radiation treatments for cancer of the parotid gland and have mostly lost my sense of taste however this tea still tastes great ,1
these are great long lasting chews for small dogs our yorkie will spend a happy hour or two with a new chew and then return to it later for more gnawing the chewing puts samson small dogs need big names in a tranquil my brain is in neutral state and my wife and i feel good because we are not poisoning him with made in china junk besides all that the chews do not stink as did some lower quality brands we tried ,1
love this soup eat it plain or use it in a recipe i can t find in my area so i m glad amazon has it ,1
i love this product as my cheat snack as it is not high in sugar but still gives me a quick sugar fix i think it is a great blend of all things yummy the only downside is that it can be addicting and if you are watching calories there is a serious need to apportion your serving prior to digging in ,1
this is my favorite gum and flavor the chewability is just right i can chew them for hours and it doesnt bother my jaw ,1
after trying several different brands i found that the timothy is breakfast blend was the very best if you do not like a strong bitter coffee then this should be your choice ,1
these are delicious my son loves them seriously delicious try them ,1
recently i ended up trying out the senseo system and i tried it with the douwe egberts medium roast pods normally i drink cold brewed toddy coffee and even though i am sensitive to bitterness and acid levels in coffee i can drink that with just dairy no sugar i immediately needed quite a bit of sugar for this coffee and then i had to start drinking half my usual amount of coffee it was so bitter i almost could not drink it it was so acidic it made my stomach hurt and it was so caffeinated i got the shakes that first time the problem was i had no idea if this was a result of the senseo process the toddy is cold brew method does result in a less bitter less acidic less caffeinated coffee than normal or the coffee brand so i ordered the ecopad refillable pods to a pack very inexpensive and tried it with the same coffee i use with the toddy it tasted slightly weak oddly however it was enough for me to realize that the main problem was the douwe egberts coffee if you really love the harsher starbucks types of coffees which i do not i think you will enjoy it but if you have acid stomach problems or just do not like bitter coffee i do not recommend using de medium roast coffee pods with your senseo ,0
these caraway seeds arrived on time without damage and as advertised i opened one package and took a whiff great i just love the smell of these guys when they are fresh which is one reason i chose this package size as i will be using them fast enough to keep them at the peak of their flavor i have found that for me the larger quantities tend to go a little flat toward the end but this size in a multipack of each with the freshness sealed in should go a long way to keeping my sourdough rye tasting as good as it can if this works out i will be ordering this again and again ,1
fresh lemon taste superior to reallemon in my opinion on the negative side the closure of this product is inferior it is a snap closure with a small peg that inserts to seal the container be careful not to bend the container when opening the package or you may have difficulty getting it to close overall recommended but the seal is an issue since the seal keeps the product fresh ,1
having bought these for myself and sent them to many on my shopping list i am here to say no one is disappointed we have organic food heads in the family and they to were pleased with theingredients as well as flavor texture and size this will be an item i will purchase again and soon packaging was excellent and product came in perfect condition,1
nice product selection in an attractive wooden chest great for the tea drinker in your life recommended ,1
i purchased these treats because i was tired of getting ripped off on tiny bags of cat treats that cost way too much the main seller of these treats entirelypets had them shipped the next day and the day after that my treats arrived the bag has plenty of treats that last a great while and the price can not be beaten my cat really loves them too i highly recommend these treats ,1
can you imagine how this product came to fruition it seems like an accident like the guys in r d accidentally filled some roll on deodorant tubes with dog food flavoring or maybe it was a large scale big lots style buy where the guys at the pet food factory got an incredibly great deal when a ban roll on factory got flooded and had to unload a warehouse in any event what seems like a really weird idea is well a really weird idea that our dog loves of course there is not much nutritional value to letting your dog take a few slurps off the end of a liver flavored roll on doggie treat but hey there is not much nutritional value to that rawhide toy you just bought him either give this a try for dessert ,1
i adopted a year old boxer mix and despite my best efforts to buy him every toy on the shelf he refuses to go near any of them when i tried the everlasting ball it was love at first sight he is not a big chewer so the construction of the ball itself is not an issue although i would not recommend it for heavy chewers and he is enamored of rolling it around trying to eat the treat it worked so well bringing out the puppy in him he even picked up a stuffed animal for the first time and played with that as well ,1
i have used several brands and types of vanilla some good some bad but this madagascar bourban vanilla is by far the best that i have used i have a cupcake delivery service and will now only use this brand for my vanilla cupcakes i have also used it in fudge and ganache and all came great very fragrant and not that alcohol smell that you get with some others definatly happy with this product ,1
yes hummos from a can can be good having it as a backup to your favorite prepared hummos or as your primary hummos it is great i really like the spicy variety but it is not available from amazon yet ,1
the askri organics sesame bars with molasses and black cumin is a great snack or meal substitute i carry one in my purse for that time when i can not find anything to eat while out running errands or on a trip out of town the bars are healthy and tasty as well ,1
i love tea all kinds of teas i do not usually like fruity black teas though so ordering this was a risk but this tea is really pleasant and pairs perfectly with sweetener and cream or milk if you prefer i did not really like it black plain the flavor was a bit too strong but milk and sweetener balance it out perfectly the subtle sweetness and tartness of the plum combined with the warmth of the cinnamon make a very nice flavor if you like chai you will probably like this tea ,1
i was looking for powdered coconut milk for a backpacking meal i had to use an extra tablespoon from what the package called for to get the same flavor as canned but otherwise it was great the boxes are large and came as a four pack so i shared with some friends i have used it at home a few times as well and its great to have on hand no more half used cans of coconut milk to deal with ,1
i love grippos they are great i would go crazy if they were not sold here but you are wrong thy are not only sold in ohio they are sold here in kentucky as well and i am so glad that they are ,1
previously made in europe later the usa but now made in china the taste and smell are not what it used to be ,0
i thought that of cocoa was enough to receive a good chocolate taste and the marshmallows gave an additional sweetness for a nice cup of hot cocoa ,1
this is by far the best coffee it has a great taste and aroma love my keurig and the many varities of kcups ,1
my dog loves these treats and nothing else will do oh she gets some biscuits and carrotswhich she likes too but nothing compares to her love of these treats she loves to cheewez and we do not like to give her rawhide so these fit the bill nicely ca not miss with these great treats ,1
this is the only tea that i will drink it has an amazing taste i have been ordering this product for some time and can always rely on value as well as the flavor ,1
this product is great i would recommend purchasing xanthan gum as well because it is not as stable as bisquick in the dough holding together just a tiny bit works wonders as mentioned before it can be purchased for less than half the price from netrition the blueberry muffins are delicious and i use regular bisquick recipes substituting carbquik and sugar substitute and have had no bad results ,1
my year old loves the squeeze applesauce so i was looking for a healthier alternative she loves the plum baby blends but this one she would not eat it has a grainy texture and bland taste ,0
this is absolutely delicious and i do not think i could make a better tasting more affordable soup like this at home i added some broken up angel hair pasta organic of course to this and heated it on the stove with some chili flakes it tastes like grown up spaghettio is divine ,1
om nom nom nom nomthese things are so god dang good i tell you whatpro tip eat the chocolate off the sides to give you one big chocolate wafer,1
the best dirty martini mix ever i had some questions about the product and the company rep mr tecosky was tremendous very very helpful ,1
i was pleased with my purchase i had been looking all over for this product which is being discontinued by the manufacturer so i was happy to be able to find this in stock shipped pretty quickly ,1
i drink my coffe black with one sugar i enjoy coffee with a strong dark roasted complex flavor and when i bought a simple pod brewer for my desk i was very disappointed with the initial weak tasting coffee that i purchased with the machine i recently purchased this pack with the hope that this coffee brewer was not bought in vain this is only my second brew but i am pleasantly surprised lets not confuse a quality drip or perculator with this pod coffee but for what it is it is convienent and tasty the one common down fall with these pod coffees is the strength to water ratio i can overfill my machine with water to get a decent cup of coffee i recommend this coffee pod ,1
i am running out of ideas to put this excellent sauce on great on salads nacho chips even spread on a bagel this is the product to buy if you like the chipotle taste but remember a little goes a long way a great value for the as the bottle really lasted a long time due to the small amount used in each serving ,1
the clear wrapper on these bars immediately reveals a product that is more like homemade bars than typical snack food and the ingredients are simple and natural on taking a bite i was impressed with the crunchy texture of the nuts and it was not too sticky to hold the flavors that stood out the most were the almonds sea salt and dark chocolate i was particularly impressed with how well the salt flavor stood up and the chocolate tastes like real chocolate that would be good alone i have become more and more of a fan of these sort of back to basics products recently and not just for health reasons while some brands do taste very bland or boring as if being natural is enough others take the taste and texture seriously with no need to hide cheap ingredients behind a wall of chemicals this is one of those delightful products ,1
i use a combination of pennery is new mexico and gebhardt is in my chili i think the combination produces a very smooth chili remember to add more of both about minutes before it is done to retain the real chili powder bite that is so good ,1
do i like coffee with my cream hell yea that is why this tasty little nuke in my mouf is getting stars for deliciousness ,1
just received this item i was shocked at how tiny it was the size should be described as mini in fact they should state the dimensions in the product description the small size is long the gnawhides are thick wide have a week old cairn weighs lbs that is a very active chewer he would probably try to swallow this thing whole it would take him longer to chew his dog food than it would one of the rawhide rings i know dog toys are not cheap if you are buying them all the time but the price for this size bone is ridiculous to me especially when you add to that the cost of the refills this toy would have been great for my pom when she was a baby she weighed lbs at months but for a small dog guess my idea of small is way different rated this item stars only because it arrived quickly ,0
very good so tasty you want more my grandson even loved them he usually does not like anything similer i would buy again pricey but so good ,1
tastes like a carbonated fruit juice that really close to soda but not exactly good stuff though carbonation will still wreak havoc on your stomach though so do not accept it as healthy just yet ,1
i had high hopes for this cool brew coffee yes it is low in acid and very smooth however the mocha flavor was almost non existent and i had to add sugar to make it sweet so the easy cup of iced mocha coffee i was hoping for was not so easy once i had to add chocolateand sugar i would return it but the shipping was more than the cool brew so i am stuck withit ,0
i like this product a lot i use it in smoothies it is packed with great elements and vitamins ,1
i am rating this stars even though i have not tried this specific product yet two out of my kitties go nuts for tuna flakes this was an emergency purchase as i ran out of what i usually buy which is from asian food grocer dot com sold as people food oz for under,1
i absolutely hate the taste of this tea but if it would work i would get it again could not find it anywhere else but i think it is too expensive ,0
was basically just instant coffee and very sweet i was hoping for one more like the tassimo cappuccino pods but no such luck will def not buy again ,0
my husband and i went to maine years ago where i discovered this blueberry coffee every little shop sold it brewed by the cup i loved it of course i bought the beans and brewed it at home but its been a few yrs now and then i got a keurig and saw these kcups it tastes just as wonderful as it cools it is even more flavorful so i decided to brew a cup cool it for later and drink it on ice oh yea it makes a great blueberry iced coffee this will be a regular hot or cold ,1
i love jam but we never finish the big pots we get tired of one flavor and open another jar and another one these little pots are ideal for us they may be a little more expensive than larger pots but if you are like us at least you won t going to waste food they are also very nice to put on the table when you have guests we love the stonewall kitchen product and their strawberry jam is consistent with their brand delicious ,1
good quality seeds a pound goes a long way nice combination of seeds this combination does have a flavor zing i do not know if its a radish or broccoli seeds that add the spicy flavor very tasty ,1
we made jell o shots with this and they came out great also mixed some coconut rum with it everyone loved them ,1
i have a black lab boxer named molly she is a highly active dog who runs at least twice a day and swims in the ocean i have been feeding her laughing dog since she was months old started with the young dog and now is on the brave dog she loves the food her coat is superior to most dogs it is by far one of the best foods out there i am very happy with it and recommend it to every pet owner ,1
these are total crap did not catch one fly followed directions to the letter no results complete rip off beware ,0
i have tried many different mineral waters to help me to quit drinking sodas i am a cola drinker and i needed something really strong all the other mineral waters went flat not long after drinking this water held its strength after being open for a few days truly unbelievable what i really like is that this water is in a glass bottle which is a plus will never drink any other brand ,1
spanish olives are not as perfumed as italian also wait for sales and you do better ,0
this is my everyday tea great favor black tea the pricing through amazon was much lower then in the stores and as i drink this tea everyday getting it in bulk is great ,1
i came across this mina harissa spicy sauce by chance it absolutely knocked my socks off and i am in love my first time at it i started off pretty conservatively with scrambled eggs after the first bite i have sincefallen totally in love with this sauce i put loads of it on and cover every square inch of my plate and i refuse to make scrambled eggs unless i have this sauce no joke buy this sauce and you will experience happiness that is until you run out if you dig hot sauce you should probably buy two or so right off the bat once you try this sauce you will be hooked gauranteed ,1
we have a year old bullmastiff and have tried iams which she would eat but was not too crazy about we decided to go with wellness a little pricey but well worth it ,1
i really enjoyed riesen and i found this candy thoroughly pleasurable this treat is dark chocolate on the outside and has a chewy caramel center on the inside its taste an texture were a real delight riesen is different unlike other candies that are overwhelming sweet and sugary riesen is full of flavor th exterior dark chocolate has a smooth feel and a rich chocolate taste for me its the flavor of the exterior that does it for me unlike other dark chocolates which can be bitter this chocolate is only cacao which gives you a great mix between sweet and dark i just wish there was more dark chocolate the interior of a riesen is chewy and has a deep rich creamy sticky caramel flavor again this caramel does not have that strong sugary taste instead you taste the richness of creamy caramel but in a hard format that becomes softer and chewier over time until it melts in your mouth this delicious long lasting caramel was excellent my only problem with this product is the lack of nutrition but im not expecting to eat kale or goji berries i come to this product for pleasure taste and texture my hats of to stock manufacturer of this wonderful candy i will continue to buy it in the future,1
i just chop them in the food processor with some celery add some nayonaise and pepper serve on a roll or bagel and it is great the only problem is that they are so good i keep eating them right out of the can while i am making lunch ,1
nylabone healthy edibles puppy chews turkey and sweet potato petite pouchthis product has given my puppies diarrhea avoid it ,0
our kids drink or more gallons of milk per week and it was taking up a disproportionate amount of space in our refrigerator compared to other things my wife remembered nido from when she was a kid so we tried it out our experience is very positive it tastes great and the kids love it now we make a gallon of milk when we run out no need to run to the store the canister is giant i have not figured out exactly how much milk it makes but its quite a bit off hand it seems like a better bang for the buck than liquid milk we are now going to be using this exclusively because it fits our lifestyle better ,1
i have long enjoyed the combination of a fruit drink mixed with sparkling water the fruit drinks by themselves tend to be too sweet and syrupy for my taste and the sparkling water cuts that and adds the zing of carbonation as well this drink does the work for me and they do it well i really enjoyed these and will buy more ,1
got this to make roja sauce but it adds complexity to many mexican dishes i love that it is in a paste form so easy to use ,1
i bought unsalted knowing they are better for me also knowing salted would probably taste better but wow these are amazing without the salt i really really like them my boyfriend will eat the whole bag if i bring them over and my mom aunt and friends all like them too ,1
these are not your run of the mill pig ears they are really big they are not greasy either i was pleasantly surprised after receiving my order am now ordering again our dogs love them ,1
just open the package and start huffing the fumes alone will get you going seriously these have the same acrid chemical bite as a dry erase marker phew if you are brave enough or stupid enough after that smell to eat a stick get your trash can ready this stuff is nasty like seriously seriously nasty with a hint of green apple it is like chewing on a green apple stick made of gasoline yuck i am not picky about my gum i am really not but i wound up spitting this out when i dared a green apple loving co worker to eat one he bit half of it off chewed it for a few seconds then said okay i am done and spit it out i suggested we keep it around for interviewees it would be a great test of character and we could evaluate how our candidate handles the pressure of being offered a piece of gum and then discovering it was poisonous but it did not fly anyway stay far far away from this one ,0
after trying,0
the words protein drink do not generally conjure up images of something that is both delicious and good for you but this product is great it does not have the smell of other powders you know the smell yuck but this makes a wonderful drink and it does not taste like any of the other dozens and dozens of sub par powders just try it if you love coffee you will love click ,1
i decided to purchase this can of rice after viewing an episode of in search of perfection in which heston blumenthal went ocd over developing the perfect risotto using his normal molecular gastronomic approach he settled on this particular brand of carnaroli rice as the basis for his perfect risotto i had a little fun showing this episode to some of my family members whipping out this can of carnaroli and then making them my own notion of the perfect risotto the felt like they had been given rock star treatment and visited italy in that sense it was worth it i subtract star because this is just about the most expensive rice that you can buy at the moment it is even more pricey than the rolls royce of rice spanish bomba bomba goes for about per kilo is this better than bomba i do not think so does it make a better risotto than a fine arborio rice i do not think so is it better than a good vialone nano again i do not think so my best risottos sprang from arborio rice ultimately i will use this rice again when i want to put on a show however it is too expensive to be my every day go to rice for risotto ,1
i am glad i got a whole case of these simple because after the first bag keep in mind these are small single serving bags i was not impressed and the sweet potato flavor overwhelmed me but after eating my second bag i liked them a lot they are a little salty but still sweet and they are a bit akin to the chip version of a baked sweet potato with some butter and maple syrup or at least that is how they tasted to me after getting over the initial reaction anyway my husband ended up eating the majority of them not because i did not want to eat them but because he liked them so much it took little over a week for him to eat of the box p me eating a bag like every other day not realizing my supply was rapidly diminishing needless to say i will absolutely be buying myself a case of these in the very near future a great snack and a wonderful change to the normal pop chips d god bless amy,1
these things stink like real fish my perry loves them i put them in an airtight container so they stay as fresh as possible and when i open the lid the smell always takes me back a bit but perry is little eyes twinkle he licks his lips and does a perfect wouldown in anticipation of his treat i used to give him duck jerky but since it is made in china i worried about the quality with these being made in alaska with wild salmon i have no worries and the salmon oil does wonder for his skin coat and joints ,1
this water enhancer by mio is really really good the flavor in question is mango peach and i found that these two flavors balanced very well together the first flavor i tasted was mango and then chased by peach it was also nice that is no aftertaste with this product the application is simple just fill a glass with water squirt a shot or two of this liquid enhancer and stir personally i use less than recommended because i do not want an overbearing flavor nevertheless an individual has the ability to make their beverage as mild or strong as they wish i also like the non leak packaging the only way the liquid comes out is if the container bottle is squeezed overall this is a good product with a good taste i have already tried the strawberry peach tea and look forward to trying other flavors ,1
i ordered the k cup assortment that was supposed to have different flavors to sample instead i received different ones and the rest were doubles two of the same i wanted to sample different flavors i only have different samples since some of them are doubled ,0
tully is french roast is a solid choice and one of my staples this is my favorite french roast currently available in a k cup maybe someday peets will come in a k cup sigh one trick if you find it is not as rich as you normally get in your favorite bistro is to make a smaller size portion ,1
even better than quaker or mother is these bob is red mill oats are the very best they are thicker cut and you get bags but with the shipping from nutricity this price is a rip off if ordered directly from bob is as of this date a four pack is including shipping and you get really fresh oats from a trustworthy source right from the mill order two cases and save even more then throw them in the freezer for as long as you need over a year is fine and pull out fresh tasty oats every time bobsredmill site we use oats every day so we order a lot did you know that the grain we call oats is really the seed of the oat plant no wonder its so nutritious after the inedible hull is removed the groat remains and is milled into all kinds of oats steel cut or irish oats old fashioned rolled oats quick oats instant oatmeal etc the great thing is that all the nutrition fiber and food value remains no matter what style of oats you choose also ground up oats can be substituted for up to one third of the flour called for in baking recipies so you can sneak in extra nutrition without anyone being able to tell the difference just put the oats and an equal amount of the flour called for in the recipe into a food processor and process till nearly smooth works great rolled oats is soluble fiber and insoluble fiber having grams of fiber per dry uncooked cup the soluble fiber floats around in your blood reducing bad cholesterol and generally cleaning up while the unsoluble fiber aids digestion and regularity you just can not get a better buy in grains than oats but dont use nutricity ,1
very happy with the product they do have a distinct smell but i just put them in a container for storage my dog absolutely loves them ,1
i thought this coffee was excellent beans had a nice sheen and very fresh full bodied with no bitter taste i use my auto drip maker on the bold setting i only buy organic coffee and have tried a few brands this one is the best ,1
i like these pop chips a lot but not all the flavors this variety pack makes a good sampler of the various flavors and then you can purchase the flavors you like these chips have strong flavor and are not greasy they are fairly filling and make a great snack they are pretty noisy like most chips so do not take em to the local theater these came well packed and they are in stay fresh packaging i can attest that they do keep well for a pretty long time as i found a bag that had gotten pushed behind some other things and after several months it still tasted fine these are a pretty good size for a quick snack quality has been consistent over several different batches i really like the texture and crunch and love the lack of greasiness ,1
i use both types like it is going outta style i put it in my protein shakes and i use it as a percent substitution in all my protein related bars of regular peanut butter being in powder formallows you to control the consistency ,1
i have tried other indian food kits in the past and have been underwhelmed to say the least not so with prima taste rendang curry sauce kit boxes pack of which was a real surprise for me easy to prepare as directed the taste is comparable to that of restaurant quality indian food the spices are well balanced while the taste and texture of the meat when prepared in this kit is both rich and succulent for indian food lovers prima taste rendang curry sauce kit is a real treat and well worth snapping up ,1
ok first lets start with the packaging forget about actually being able to pull the two sides apart at the top of the bag to get it open and just get the sissors out of the misc drawer and cut the top off then of course it does not seal very well by rolling the bag down and bending the ends of the wire over that is stuck to the bag there is no way to get anything even close to a seal so before opening try to find something to put the coffee in after you get the bag open i used an empty ovaltine jar the ovaltine would have made better coffee than this does when i opened the bag of coffee it had a distinct burnt smell to it with just a faint hint of vanilla hiding in it it smelled the same as it was brewing in my drip coffee maker from other flavored coffee is that i have tried i have got used to cutting it scoops of flavored coffee to one of folgers this time i used some of the french roast folgers which was a waist of a scoop of good folgers coffee the directions on the bag says to use two level teaspoons of it for every oz of cold fresh water i cant even imagine trying to drink a cup as strong as it would be brewed to those directions i have tried this coffee with just a little sugar the way that i usually like my coffee and it was not drinkable i tried it with a little chocolate flavored creamer then a lot of sugar and a lot of chocolate flavored creamer and it still was not drinkable i would really like to have a nice cup of vanilla flavored coffee but i am not going to get one from this no matter what i have tried with it it still tastes burnt i even tried it with some french vanilla flavored creamer and it still tastes burnt i would really like to be able to say something positive about this coffee but i cant i tried to brew a pot in my new bunn hg phase brew home brewer even the bunn coffee maker could not get a decent tasting cup of coffee from this and it makes the best coffee i have ever had maybe this bag came from a bad batch that got burnt by being roasted too long maybe what ever puts the vanilla flavoring in it was almost out and it did not get enough or as much as it was supposed to get from all the other positive reviews i must have got a bad bag or maybe its because i was a heavy smoker for over yrs before i quit smoking yrs ago and i still have damaged taste buds something was causing this to produce undrinkable coffee and if it was not the coffee then it has to be something else making it taste bad unless you like coffee that tastes burnt do not waist your money on this ,0
yes this is an extreme rip off go to costco and save money it is now and change at costco but still the granola is awesome but i am disappointed i cannot get this online cheap ,1
if you want pumpking flavored coffee buy the timothys perfectly pumpkin coffee instead i bought it at kohls a couple weeks ago with a off coupon i had and some kohls cash and glad i did not waste a lot of money on it green mountain coffees are usually good and i loved the timothys pumpkin i got last year so decided to try this and was disappointed like others have said it is weak and taste nothing like pumpkin the flavor is not bad if you want a weaker nutmeg cinnamon flavored coffee but it tastes nothing like pumpkin ,0
i had this tree sent to my daughter for her birthday but it arrived in poor condition and only got worse we fared no better with a second attempt we were very disappointed to say the least but amazon was very cooperative about our return ,0
i was forced to find another coffee brand that carried cappuccino flavored ooffee after my usual supplier went out of business coffee masters met my expectations their coffee is smooth and delicious ,1
switch is a lightly carbonated beverage that claims of what you want of what you do not unfortunately i count calories and i do not want calories for something that tastes like a slightly fizzy apple juice drink the flavor was supposed to be black cherry but it tasted strongly of apple juice which makes sense since it is one of its main ingredients i simply do not see myself switch ing to this drink rather than my diet black cherry or diet cherry cola soda if i want to drink a vitamin drink then i turn to emergen c which is much lower in calories and packs a huge vitamin wallop it also adds a carbonated feel to juice products when i choose one of those so unlike the advertising i did not find switch to be the perfect balance between juice and carbonation ,0
i love this red rooibos tea especially nowbecause i am avoiding all the caffeine for nursing my baby i like this tea hot of course i also tried to make this cold it was really good too ,1
when i crave fish crackers i eat glutino gluten free cheddar crackers they are great with an apple with cheese or just plain ,1
uncovered sparkling ice on a trip to california with my daughter last july it is the answer to a healthy drink with absolutely no calories and just enough flavor to make spring water interesting without being overly sweet plus a little fizz which i love enjoy being able to order it by the case from amazon ,1
i have enjoyed black tea all my life and have always hated flavored teas until this one i put a little cream in it along with half a pack of sweet n low and enjoy it every afternoon i have had bigelow is as others have suggested and they are both excellent i am on my box of this and i love it ,1
nothing comes close to tim horton is french vanilla in my book it is perfectly packaged just add oz of water and sit back and ejoy the smooth rich french vanilla flavor that other coffee shops just cannot duplicate so glad to know that amazon is selling this as i often had to either travel to canada have someone bring it to me or find another location in the us to drive to and get a case even rented a car in boston drove almost hours to rhode island and back just to get a case of timmy is also found some in new york city at a couple of locations ,1
the product was not delivered and amazon did not notify me nor have they credited by credit card,1
each box of tazo chai includes ounces of concentrate that you will mix with roughly the same volume of milk the result is simply the best chai tea latte that i have had except for the chai latte you would get in the starbucks store this is not that drink but a similar but inferior product yet you will be able to buy a better at home product and the price here on amazon at the time of this writing is better than any that i know of in stores we go through about boxes of this per week and i am happy to be able to get it on amazon tax free with free shipping ,1
if there is a problem with these fruit sticks it is that they are too delicious our year old loves his fruit sticks they do have or so of sugar ,1
this is the only food that my yorkie will eat this size will last about a month and a half again depends on the size of your pup but worth it her coat is silky and this food does not make her ill ,1
walnut acres organic baked beans is an excellent product comparable or better than brand names available everywhere we will order again product arrived in excellent condition and on schedule ,1
my wife and i have been searching for a replacement for a more floral variety of earl grey tea that we enjoyed for years but can no longer get as i paged through davidson is tea catalog i saw this blend and decided to give it a try i was pleased by the aroma of lavender and bergamot when i opened the package and so was my wife so the first thing we did was brew a pot and give it the taste test i am glad to say it passed the test though with just perhaps a tiny bit too much lavender but that is being very picky the pricing is good packaging is excellent delivery was timely we like this tea and will be re ordering in the future we give this a very high recommendation ,1
i was looking for kellog is corn flakes when i found these i thought i would try them since i could not find kellog is i am sooo glad that i did these corn flakes are terrific they have a wonderful flavor and the texture is excellent not flimsy and whimpy like the kellog is these are the best corn flakes i have ever had ,1
though the product description makes this sound like a healthy snack one look at the ingredient list tells otherwise full of artificial flavoring dyes corn syrups and a myriad of things i can not pronounce this is not what i will reach for when i want a healthy snack on the upside there are only calories per bar and while i refused to taste it my taste tester at home proclaimed it to be really good crisp and chewy at the same time good perhaps for those not concerned about ingredients and only calories but not for my lifestyle ,0
yes i got the product all i counted and none of them were melted this was a concern for other lindt chocolates ordered online this may also be because i ordered it in december it tastes just as i remembered from eating them in store tip though it is cheaper ordering them online at per candy than in store except during the holiday season i went to my local cvs during the christmas season and got those two ounce packages of lindt chocolates for dollars each with candies in each it comes down to for each candy so stock up during the holidays ,1
this coffee is smooth with no bitter aftertaste even when used on the oz water mark it still gives you a rich even strong cup of coffee not watered down ,1
maldon salt is acknowledged to be the most elegant salt made irregular flakes make it ideal for finishing although it would be something of a waste to dissolve it in cooking the flakes provide a isurprise when you encounter them rather than an all over saltiness for another dimension i recommend trying the smoked maldon salt the smoke flavor is much more subtle than the aroma maldon flakes occupy one end of the spectrum very clean and balanced while a good fleur de sel adds it is own flavors due to the microorganisms contained in it again it is for finishing and would be a waste for cooking both represent the epitome of sea salts no other sea salts are in the running those red and black salts colored with clay are no more than novelty products manufactured for a curious public ,1
this product was definately a waste my money it certainly did not taste like butter and had no buttery taste to it which is what the claim is i guess that is why they have the six pack purchase because they know this stuff isn is worth it also feel that they are trying to get rid of this stuff if i could return this it would certainly be in the mail by now for a refund terrible buttery popcorn topping if you have taste buds you will be dissappointed ,0
i thought these were the same as i purchased at christmas time from costco i purchased these for valentine is day and they are just awful they taste like cocoa covered lard do not care what the price is i would rather have a delicious taste like the ones from costco they do not have them anymore i do not know how anybody can say these taste delicious they have no taste at all ,0
these cherries are fresh and delicious shipping was fast and well packaged it is important to store these cherries properly to preserve the flavor i re bagged the cherries in smaller zip lock bags and stored them in my fridge ,1
this is a great new flavor in a bulk type bag each one makes two gallons and is great for big families or parties i live by myself and use a tablespoon to make a gallon pitcher full i might add more powder if i want to use a lot of ice in my glass as i have been doing this awful hot summer so that the drink remains strong enough to enjoy and not get too watery i like to make my own flavors and have added some of the wild strawberry to some of the crystal light teas to create another good drink i would like to see even more flavors packed this way so i can experiment with new combinations ,1
i opened up the package it smelled really bad the kids would not even taste them so i decided to give one a try it was just wrong got to looking and found mold growing on some of the medallions i could not find an expiration date on the package but i am guessing it was some time during wwii i thought the whole point of beef jerky was to preserve the beef i am going to try to post a picture to the item page i contacted customer service and they are sending out a replacement hopefully it will be less fuzzy tried the teriyaki flavor and they are ok nothing to write home about though ,0
i really enjoy my stash preium earl grey tea and orange spice black tea i am so glad that i was able to order it direct because you can not find the orange spice black tea in the grocery stores locally ,1

my dogs love these rawhides they last a long time and do not leave a stain on your carpet even though they are beef basted ,1
i really love the gummi raspberry candies these are not particularly soft or fresh tasting and the candy non pareils the little beady candies are a bit too large perhaps other haribo candies are better but i can not enthusiastically recommend these ,0
i am lucky my food store no longer carried the us produced tangerine juice i was purchasing because it caused me to look for tangerine juice at amazon and their i found volcano tangerine juice produced in italy and at a reasonable price this juice is sweet tangy and is delicious much better than the us juice i had tried previously i would recommend it without reservation ,1
the k cups i received were of a diverse variety i did not get one item that was the same i received about the same amount of flavored coffees as the regular coffees the rest include cider hot chocolate about or so decaf coffees and teas this is a true sample pack i did not check every single cup but the ones i did check were not expired the biggest problem i have from this order is trying to decide which to try first awesome ,1
i love this full bodied coffee i have a couple of cups in the morning to get myself moving it is strong but i just add a little more water and i love it ,1

i have rottweiler and he used eat just about anything now that he is older he seems to be a bit picky i placed this food next to his regular food that i feed him and he chose this chef michael is food this bag is not the cheapest but i get every once in a while to cycle their food great ingredients and i am sure the dog liked the taste of the food ,1
i like coffee and my wife likes coffee despite the fact that we were warned starting at a very early age that coffee would stunt our growth and do all kinds of horrible things to our growing little bodies both of us starting drinking coffee at a very early age no it did not stunt our growth or have any of the other horrid side effects on us in later life it did when i was a wee one make me rather hyper but i suspect i would have been that way anyway i have always been in a state hovering between that of giant tree sloth and a crazed ferret depending on what day of the week it is seemingly anyway as things stand now we still drink quite a lot of coffee with two large pots being consumed daily to be quite honest over the years we have been more inclined to purchase what ever brand was on sale at the time although our two old stand bys have always been folgers and maxwell house of the two this folgers french grind dark or medium dark probably has the edge over the rest when we can get it both of us simply like the flavor better now that being said and truth be told the breaking point as to whether or not you like a certain brand of coffee greatly depends upon what you get use to i know full well that many swear by the process of buying their own beans grinding their coffee to suit their taste and proceeding from there i do not doubt for a second that this is good coffee i have had coffee prepared this way many times and it is indeed good for us though the process of going through this the extra cost of having a quality coffee grinder the time involved and the extra cost of the truly fresh coffee beans simply is not worth the trouble that is just us though and our particular life style no we will stick to this stuff and the maxwell house it is what we are use to it is what we enjoy we will switch from on to the other depending which is on sale at the time i must say the cost of this coffee here on amazon if you belong to one of the free shipping programs is quite attractive and quite competitive i also like the empty plastic containers and have dozens of uses for them around the house and no we did not let our children or grandchildren start drinking coffee at an early age we feared that it would stunt their growth and do horrid things to their growing bodies anyway this is a great product and meets our needs perfectly don blankenshipthe ozarks,1
this little saltines are the best i have ever tasted and surpass the larger version by a mile i put them in my soup or use them as a snack these are really great tasting ,1
i have made spaghetti sauce from scratch but this packet makes it so easy and tastes just as good just follow directions but instead of water add canned or home grown tomatoes as i did the sauce will be thicker and with out any additives or salt as in the canned tonatoes you will really enjoy the flavor after it has simmered for about one hour at very low temperature ,1
we received a tassimo coffee machine for christmas and are enjoying the convience and taste of these wonderful t disc my wife really enjoys the lattes and this is a convenient way to enjoy one ,1
while we are generally a fairly health conscious family the easy mac has become a staple at our house we often will mix it with tuna or organic chilly to create quick easy and delicious lunches the single serving is excellent for those of us who are into portion control the serving is also perfect for children it gives them just enough but not too much for our area the price here at amazon is much cheaper than buying it at the store ,1
bought the sourdough starter for my daughter who is a nutritionist she has made a hobby out of it and shared the starter with friends it makes awesome bread and rolls best bratwurst buns ever ,1
this is my cat is third favorite food it is great stuff the gravy is so very thick and the food looks like bits of steak slicked off for your friend my cat licks the bowl clean every time and wants more they should send me discounts for as much of this stuff i buy i buy it by the case if that gives you some idea ,1
we have been looking all over for a wheat orzo and decided to try this it has worked very well in all our orzo recipes hot and cold save for one that was just ok it has a stronger flavor than regular pasta made with bleached flour so it does best in recipes with bolder flavors like most wheat pastas it needs to be boiled for just the shortest amount of time so that it remains very firm we have not overcooked it yet so i can not say if it will get mealy and mushy like a lot of wheat pastas do highly recommended ,1
i gave this to the wife for her to use after a couple of applications she said that it did help her hair and was repairing the split ends she said would not know about the color repair since her hair is turning silver anyway looking at her hair it seemed to me that it seemed fluffier and the color was a little bit bolder but hey what does a man know ,1
i am buying this product on a monthly basis to help reduce in the amount of kidney stones aloe helps break up kidney stones in your body and this will help ,1
my dog chewed booda bimple bones from puppyhood and he loved them he would chew for what seemed like hours and drift away into a doggy zen state then booda changed the formula they made the bones softer and more digestible and my dog could eat the largest size in about minutes he is only pounds and the next day it was bad bad tummy trouble instead of chewing pleasure it was gobbling and looking for more i tried the n bone yesterday i was a little anxious that it would be the same situation but the n bone seems a good bit harder and my dog really had to work at chewing it which is a good thing i am still not sure the n bone will last longer than a single chewing session but at least it did not get eaten in minutes i had the package in my briefcase and when my dog passed by he did a u turn and started sniffing and pawing at the bag so i know it is definitely appealing to him ,1
i use this with my aeropress espresso maker wow super smooth and creamy no bitterness ,1
although not exactly as i remember raisin bread it is a welcome treat after so long without it has a good texture toasts well but could have more cinnamon flavor it is somewhat pricey but i miss bread so i splurge a little update i need to warn consumers that although this packaging should last until the expiration date you must examine this bread before you use it at you can not eat this bread too fast even though it is light as i got to the last three loaves i noticed mold on most of the slices i hoped none was tainted that was already eaten it was well before the expiration date i now have too much of a distrust of this product to order it again the ener g company took the bad bread back and will send me replacement loaves they asked why i did not order from them from now on i think i will it can not be any more expensive this price is no bargain ,0
i am a bit of spice hound and have flirted with other hot sauces before but nothing has ever seized hold of me like sriracha an old greenwich village burger joint near where i worked at nyu used to serve it on the tables with popcorn and the combo was killer the memory haunted me for years before i finally picked up a bottle i should not have waited this stuff is amazingly addictive with a garlicky sweet hot yumminess that is hard to describe it sits on my table in front of the salt and pepper and i have drained a bottle in a month period incredible on eggs superb on burritos utterly transforms dull dietetic chicken vegitable dishes from the chinese restaurant i put a squirt in the health low sodium soups instead of more salt and all of a sudden all the flavors perk up utterly highest recommendation ,1
the shipping was fast and the customer service was excellent i was just very disappointed in the product itself the product claims to give energy and reduce appetite yet after drinking the tea i never experienced a decrease in appetite or any energy would not buy it again ,0
i have anjoyed the kashi golean oatmeal raisin cookie bar for several years now i first found them in my local grocery store when looking for something nutritious that i could eat on the go i was not looking for some super high protein body building muscle mass enhancing behemoth of an energy bar just something that could fill an unusually long gap between meals or even take the place of a small breakfast or lunch i was attracted to kashi products because of the ingredients they use and commenced reading the labels of all of them this product had the best ingredients listing kashi is seven whole grains sesame cereal as the first and not listing anything scary or questionable at all the taste of the bar while not exactly like an oatmeal raisin cookie is excellent first you taste the honey that is used in the exterior icing or coating then you continue to a softer than chewy center that contains real raisins great mouth feel excellent taste this bar is filling enought to replace a small meal and i always take some with me when travelling after all who really wants airport food bring with you something you want that is nutritious and costs about used to be able to find these in my local grocery or target store for about however nobody seems to carry them anymore enter amazon through the subscribe save program i get a box of bars delivered for free shipping at the interval of my choosing that is only about and i do not have to run all over town looking for them i am now a very happy camper and traveler and outdoorsman and worker thanks amazon ,1
i did not purchase this product for myself but it was important enough that i wanted to review anyway a family member of mine is undergoing weekly chemotherapy obviously that means nausea and vomiting around the time when he is undergoing chemo this is basically all he wants to eat and the only thing he can eat without making him feel worse he ran out recently and he could not find them in any stores in town i immediately thought of amazon he had been rationing his last one when i ordered it and it came the next day it sounds so silly but this was such an important purchase and i am so grateful that amazon carried it and prime too to be able to make this experience just slightly easier for him means so much thank you amazon ,1
all boxes were fresh the bran part gets soggy pretty quick and the raisens tend to sink to the bottom great natural tasting cereal imo way better than raisen bran crunch ,1
both my dogs go crazy over this i originally bought it for treats but one of my dogs has decided she is not going to open her mouth for any reason whatsoever unless this is mixed in or is her treat i have made a monster truthfully i am happy this inspires her to eat she has been a fussy eater since i have had her it has not been unusual for her to go a day and a half without eating however with this i know she will eat i just crumble some in her breakfast and dinner bowl and she will slurp it right up for lunch she gets cup of kibble and a half slice of this which i crumble up and put in her bob a lot toy by starmark in no time it is gone i love this stuff ,1

received product in a timely manner but it had a best by date of that is almost a year past not happy with it at all ,0
i had high hopes of this food after seeing the ingredients and reading the reviews but my cats will not touch the stuff it has a very thin slop like texture whole peas and is a pale grayish brown color the only way they will eat it is if i mix it with other food and even then they turn their noses up at it most of the time i should have bought one can at the pet store before committing to on amazon next time i will be smarter ,0
okay i have tried several of this company is products and they are fair however this one was shockingly bad the flavor was not just bland it was repulsive it was disturbing to imagine this is something people actually enjoy i have given up on it i have decided to not eat the other cans i cannot in good faith give it to others ,0
great product and shipped quickly as promised good job will probably order from them again is price remains competitive ,1
we enjoy hot air popped corn to cut the oil but it also cuts flavor so what we have come up with is to spray butter flavored cooking spray on the frshly popped corn the sprinkle on some flavacol toss in the bowl and repeat until you get the right flavor be aware that a little flavacol goes a long way so do not over do it ,1
i grew up on kraft mac n cheese in the blue box and still love it my kids love it too when i picked up a box of deluxe i had only the highest expectations it starts out the same cooking the dried noodles in boiling salted water then you add the packet of cheese sauce and things go downhill from there first of all the cheese is like the kind you get from the convenience store for your nachos and not the good ones either it seems like hot liquid plastic that glows orange the taste is somewhat bitter artificial and chemical like my kids took one bite and said eew i thought they were overreacting because how bad could something i have enjoyed in the blue box be especially the deluxe version in the end we ended up throwing the whole batch out still love the original but will not be buying the deluxe again ,0
i thought this would be wonderful because i love nuttela let me tell you this is a terrible product i have never had a nut butter that was so bad even the natural peanutbutter i tried was not this bad first let me say if your looking for a nuttela like product buy nuttela this product tastes like they took peanut shells added water oil and a pinch of poor quality chocolate put it in a blender and pulsed it twice the texture is gritty at best i swear they used shells not nuts horrible thew it away immediately ,0
i prefer pu erhs that are earthy slightly smoky and finish smoothly while this tea does not completely fit this profile it will do it is not as good as some pricier pu erhs but it is as good an everyday tea as i have found other tea lovers in my family have adopted it as their regular morning tea even though they are not the pu erh aficionados that i am ,1
we have to feed our cat to pills a day and he is a very picky eater so it is been impossible to get pills into him without a struggle as he will not eat them if they are just disguised in food these are brilliant they are soft like plasticene and you just stuff the pill into the pocket squeeze it closed and voila instant cat treat he begs for them now why on earth nobody stocks them in the uk i will never know ,1
anyone who says this tastes like choc milk or yoo hoo is nuts i had it over ice and could hardly get it down i wanted to like it and am extremely disappointed that it is so bad tasting delivery was not what i expected either it came in a box with many other items it was way too heavy and the box was ripped to shreds i think the ups guy carried it to my door like a basket and everything fell out i guess the good news is it came quickly along with the disappointment ,0
i love the strawberry hi chews if you are familiar with the american candy mambas this is similar but much hi chews have much more flavor they make my mouth they are not hard but rather chewy almost like bubble gum this makes them last much longer and you do not have to worry about your fillings getting ripped out delicious ,1
we always have this container of lollipops on the counter everyone who tries them always comes back for more they are not sicky sweet like most suckers but are a little bit on the tart side adults who try them really like them our grandkids enjoy them too if you decide to buy these you will definitely not be disappointed and you will order them again ,1
as a non gluten person i believe this bread tops all others that i have purchased at the grocery store and private bakery ,1
the main reason i am reviewing these is just to let everyone know that these are fresh i was wondering how fresh they would be in case they were not popular and sat in the warehouse for a long time they are very good and i will be ordering more one note is that they come in a plain plastic sealed bag not the jelly belly logo but thats not a huge deal ,1
my husband is gluten free but i am not either way this is the best cake that i have had in a long time we make it for all birthdays and celebrations now it is so moist and delicious we make it with egg replacer because he is also vegan mmm i am craving a slice right now ,1
i have this granola every day with greek yogurt and i have not had anything better than this obviously it is a matter of personal preference but this is definitely a high quality choice ,1
these are good granola bars we buy them at the grocery store but are way cheaper here the only problem is sometimes they get very hard the grocery store ones are softer i am not sure if that is from shipping here in a cold climate or what also the expiration date can be very close i was getting low on the bars and then ordered more and realized the expirate date is coming up in a few weeks when the last case had a later date so it makes me wonder how fresh these are ,1
we are so thrilled to be able to have hamburger helper potato stroganoff we love it and it is not available in our area now when we go shopping and come to the hamburger helper shelf in the store we say ha ha ha we have hamburger helper potato stroganoff and you do not lol silly we know but thanks to amazon we have got it yay thanks amazon ,1

okay i am a popchip addict the first step is admitting there is a problem i first tried them when they were served to me instead of chips in a deli in nyc i kept the bag and found them on amazon and started buying them by the case not as salty as regular chips they also have considerably less grease more of a tasty rice cake experience than a greasy lay is chip i have bought cases of the single serve bags and end up giving them to friends and coworkers who turn around and order them for themselves yeah they are good ,1
this is gourmet granola with a great chocolate taste the chunks of chocolate are actually that real chunks of quality dark chocolate the granola itself is also really good crunchy and with a great bite it is not exactly health food but a small handful makes a great snack between meals ,1

after my husband was diagnosed with diabetes he had to cut back on his carbs he loves pasta but one serving cup of regular pasta just was not worth it to him he loves carba nada and says the taste and texture are great for those counting carbs this is the pasta for you it would be nice if it was available in a spaghetti or elbow noodle style but otherwise the product is a ,1
definitely not a roast for the weak gets me going on those mornings that i have trouble getting out of bed ,1
i have tried lots of brands of chocolate chips yes i am a chocolate snob and only nestle or hershey tastes great in your cookie do not waste your money on store brand or ghirardelli this size package is for the serious cookie baker but the price from this vendor i see today is more expensive than buying smaller packages in the grocery store sam is club has this for under,1
i bought these inexpensive little bars because they were on sale but my expectations were not very high to my pleasant surprise i discovered that not only are the bars low fat but they taste great too the bars have a chewy consistency and taste quite a bit like an oatmeal raisin cookie but not as sweet or cake like although the bars are on the small side i have found them to be just as filling as other breakfast bars recommended as a great anytime snack ,1
in full honesty i thought i had order one pound of sanding sugar at the same price and was a little confused when i opened the box since i really did not need a pound i decided to keep this product i agree with the other review that rated these expensive for what they are just slightly colored sugar i sprinkled them on my daughter is birthday cake and she liked them a few minutes at the most later when we cut the cake the had already melted dissolved into the frosting i used them on white frosting and they were very had to see even at application bottom line i would not recommend this product ,0
we got this because the white cheddar was out of stock and i have to say it is just as good or better than the white cheddar our yr old loves it it tastes a lot like kraft only better ,1
the package was warm after being inside of a mail truck all day and thus the coating of chocolate melted ,1
i love french vanilla coffee and was looking forward to this it turned out to be a huge disappointment because all i could taste was the milk i put in the coffee when you read reviews of the keurig coffee makers people recommend using bolder darker roasts the van houtte french vanilla is a light roast so i obviously knew it was not going to be strong but to be devoid of any flavor is not acceptable when i made the coffee this morning i even paused the keurig during the brew cycle to wet the grounds better in order to produce a more flavorful cup i also used the oz setting rather than the oz setting on my machine none of this had any effect the coffee pouring into my cup was a nice rich color but there was no coffee or vanilla aroma emanating from it in this case i honestly do not understand the positive reviews on this product i actually like light roasts but this is the first time i have had one that left me wondering where the coffee and the vanilla flavor was ,0
these licorice wheels are classic molasses flavored licorice and just the right amount of sweetness the wheels consist of a string wound into a round shape so you can unwind and eat them as string if you prefer you might because they are pretty chewy as classic licorice should be the bags are tough and very well sealed you will want scissors to get them open the only problem is that there is just not much licorice here the total is only a bit over twenty ounces so you are basically paying the price of high quality chocolate for licorice even though i liked them i can not cost justify them and i will not be buying again ,1
i tried this new caramel latte macchiato for the first time today and wow the vanilla latte has been my favorite of the dolce gusto coffees since i bought my piccolo but this caramel latte is tied with the vanilla now it smells so good brewing sort of like the best caramel apples at the state fair combined with a hint of pecan pie baking inhaling it made me think of the first fall frosts the taste is smooth and silky and there is no doubt this is a caramel flavored coffee the vanilla is a hint of flavor and this one is not shy or subtle in the least i normally add a teaspoon of sugar to the other flavors but this one is sweet enough on it is own to not need any additional sugar make sa very nice after dinner coffee or late afternoon soda replacement ,1
last time i bought this product it was at the cost of from amazon but now in may the price is why such a big price increase now amazon is more expensive then most other retailers this is weird as amazon usually has the lowest prices sams club the cost is each so would be come on amazon for such a popular product on amazon lower the price and make sure you have plenty of stock on hand by the way the product is great but the pump tends to clog so do not tighten the cap too tight so you can later remove it and rinse it with hot water to remove the clog ,1
for a long time my son refused to eat jarred baby food and these were a lifesaver he could hold them and eat them on his own and he loved the texture probably because he was teething highly recommended ,1
greenies are the house crowd pleaser my westie who is not food oriented will pull out every trick in her repertoire before i can ask to get one of these my lab starts to drool when he sees one my shihvanese practically does back flips everyone loves greenies i like how they leave my dogs breath sweet smelling and teeth clean easily digestible senior formulas with joint help great on their digestive system just a great great product ca not recommend it enough i will say though if your dog is a gulper please make sure you watch them while they eat chew they seem to like it so much that you really need to be on hand just in case as is true with any chewy product for your furkids ,1
without any added sugar blue monkey has managed to make the sweetest but not too sweet most refreshing coconut water it is my daily treat after a hot yoga sesh ,1
i have always loved hearts of palm but not these ones the taste is good but these roland hearts of palm are hard as rocks it may appear unbelievable but only one stem out of ten were eatable i would need special dog like teeth to eat these will look for another brand of softer and more teeth friendly ones ,0
my dog will destroy nearly any toy within five minutes we buy all sorts of things that claim to be super durable but he goes right through them so quickly and he is only a dog so far nylabone and kong toys are the only ones that we can rely on ,1
this bread rises and tastes great and manages to be healthier than many other gluten free breads it also slices to make sandwiches very nicely this bread is highly recommended it calls for a few items to add to the bread mix and takes a few minutes to rise but it comes with its own yeast packet that works very well ,1
i was truly disappointed when i received this product it did not work with my machine and it was a total waste of money ,0
before going gf we loved annie is mac and cheese we really missed it when we found this we were thrilled it is very good the pasta has a fabulous consistency annie is should sell it by itself the problem is that one box does not make very much i need to make two boxes to make to make enough for my family it is pricey as well and spending almost on a little bit of comfort food is only worth it now and then it is great for a treat but not a staple in my pantry ,1
a friend from chili gave me some coco matte tea and it will show up positive for cocaine on a drug test be aware if you have to have drug tests ,0
when i received the shipment the packing box was in great condition i opened it to find the box tightly packed with bubble wrap and securely taped with shipping tape it took a box cutter to remove the protective bubble wrap once removed i found the can of cherries so badly dented and damaged that it looked like it had been dropped from a third story window and there was no way to even attempt to open it it had clearly been wrapped for shipping in that condition my only conclusion was that the product is being sold by a distributer who has a a badly damaged shipment that they need to unload because they can not sell it to their usual restaurant clients to amazon is credit when i contacted them about the problem they responded to my email within about two hours and had credited the cost of the purchase back to my credit card by the end of the same day ,0
i have been taking this product for almost months now it has helped me with all my symptoms of menopause in particular the hot flashes if i skip days of taking these the hf come back full force it took about a week of capsule a day to help i have never taken more than a day although the recommendations on the bottle says tablets three times daily i am sure if i took two a day i would have different results possibly better but i am plenty satisfied with what these already have done for me i shared them with my husband for the first days he said he saw no noticeable difference we do not really have much trouble in that department anyway so he may need it more in the future wonderful product i am so pleased with it without it i am afraid i would have needed a hormone replacement that was prescription or a cave to live in til this passes i have placed another order today as always thanks amazon ,1
these are my delicious breakfast only problem is i eat them too fast and have to reorder too soon but i am glad that i was able to find a souce as they are not available in any retail stores here in east kansas ,1
i purchased this coffee for my husband he likes a bold cup of coffee excellant choice great taste ,1
i enjoyed trying all the various flavors this was an excellent choice do not hesitate to try it you will not regret it ,1
i was so excited to see gluten free bisquick my grandmother and mother both used it i fondly remember their strawberry shortcake so that was the first thing i made i almost cried it was so good i have since made the pancakes yum yum and baked chicken i am a regular at their web site liveglutenfreely com for its great recipes thank you bisquick ,1
the flavor of this latte is a delight a creamy pumpkin taste with a slight touch of cinnamon and ginger less than what could be nicer i found myself wishing i had a piece of pumpkin pie to accompany the latte that would be ideal however i would be concerned about having it on a daily basis because of the inclusion of partially hydrogenated coconut oil as when coconut oil is hydrogenated it becomes a trans fat and trans fats have been closely associated with heart disease nevertheless it is stated that trans fat is how can that be and saturated fat is i would also like to know the percentage of instant coffee in the latte one serving is calories not bad and of the calories are fat sodium is mg not bad total carbs sugars and protein felt when drinking this latte like i was having a treat no harsh coffee taste and no harsh after effect the directions say to serve it in a mug with four teaspoons of latte i personally like it a bit stronger so i had it in a somewhat smaller cup and added a little more latte um um good ,1
this is a very flavorfukl salt in a good way a little goes a long way ,1
i had this first in las vegas when i went for a trip i was so thirsty from walking around in the hot desert when i went to a restaurant bouchon they did not have any lemonade so the waiter offered me this stuff i was not sure at first i thought it was a trick to get me to pay more money for something that is the equivalent of squeezed lemon in water with some sugar but it was so good i had limonada everyday when i was in vegas everywhere that they offered it i would demand to have a bottle of the good stuff unfortunately when i came back to my natural habitat on the east coast i did not find any limonada anywhere when i tried to google for it even that masterful search engine found nothing fast forward a couple months later i go to a charity event they offer as a giveaway to the people who attended drinks sponsored by san pellagrino heart be still it was my beloved limonada in the us in the north say what hoping that maybe limonada had somehow made its way to my cold region i decided to try again my search i looked online behold amazon this retailer sells it in packs in the glass bottle straight from the bubbling springs of italy i purchased some right away in did not care if shipping was about double the price of the product a few days later these wonderful bottles made it is way to my refrigerator i have been enjoying one a day this supplier seems to have the best price so far of all the places i have looked you can get a larger quantity for cheaper price per bottle one retailer is selling it for for free shipping for like a case with however if you want to try it out first you might want to go with this listing currently the price is including shipping handling for bottles not a bad deal for the most delicious bubbly lemonade in the world ,1
my wife was very happy with these flowers and i was very happy with the ease of ordering and the delivery of the flowers ,1
they missed christmas delivery by days customer service is very unknowledgeable google reviews for them before buying ,0
great quality especially for the price this tea is smooth and floral it has a rich mouthfeel but the flavor is delicate enough that i do not recommend pairing it with anything but the mildest foods very much worth the money ,1
great product and authentic may be fresher than your used to so use scantly when just opened as advertised and tasty ,1
these pizza crusts are wonderful each package makes inch pizza crusts or personal size pizza crusts they are great to prepare ahead and freeze making for a wonderfully affordable fast and easy gluten free meal the only drawback of the packaging is that it is pretty difficult to try to make a single crust at a time ,1
the diamond walnuts i have received from amazon are always fresh and have a good taste that is important because i have bought walnuts in the grocery store that either did not have any taste or were rancid ew i have never received a bad batch of diamond walnuts sent by amazon the price is better than buying in a local store i receive six bags every other month ,1
this pasta is delicious and cooks to a wonderful al dente i absolutely recommend it for the additional health benefits of the quinoa which i personally do not like in it is original form ,1
coffee was not bad but the majority of k cup pods malfunctioned and sent coffee grounds everywhere spent more time cleaning brewer than enjoying coffee even when they did not blow up there were always grounds in the coffee ,0
wow eat a few and you are fine eat a half of handful and you will be popping in a few hours eat a handful or more and you better stay near a bathroom for the rest of the day these taste great just like the regular ones but they will affect you in more ways than one ,0
first let me say that the product itself is excellent and i have no problems with it this review is mainly about amazon is idea of proper packaging i ordered this with super saver shipping and it will be the last time from now on i will order from another vendor and pay for shipping when i received the package it was stained and cans had been so severely damaged that they were leaking others were questionable and others were severely dented but safe to use i work in a canning facility so i know how to test vacuum in cans the product was packaged with no padding at all in a box that was a good deal larger than the item i saved no money at all on free shipping as i had to discard cans of an already expensive cat food ,0
this caught my eye at the grocery store because of the flax seed ingredient i was shocked that it tasted better then i expected it is the best oatmeal i have found and a new favorite in the house ,1
for years i just bypassed this stuff at the checkout counter because it seemed like a gimmick but holy cow i tried it and it is great the advertising is right that you do not really crash when it runs out and it does not make you as jittery as drinking a huge cup of coffee for me no jitters when i drink half a little jittery if i drink the whole thing i also find that it has a mood enhancing effect the taste is fine like a concentrated energy drink but you are not drinking it for the taste the price on amazon is the best i have found online if you consider shipping although watch out because they change around the prices for different flavors i guess depending on their stock ,1
solid product from gu as usual i prefer these to the off brand gel packs espresso love is one of the better flavors ,1
my oldest daughter is very into natural healing and products she suggested manuka honey it has a very good taste and can be used externally as well my youngest daughter had a place on her arm we applied the honey the next day it was completely gone we also did this on a cat who was having skin problems this is an excellant product ,1
i just adore these snacks i have only tried white cheddar so far but am coming back to try another flavor i bought them when doing atkins at just carb per serving yet crunchy and tasty it was quite a nutritional bargain now i have switched to weight watchers and these yummy little gems are only points plus per pack there may be an acquired taste period for the first pack but it passes quickly i can not say enough about just the cheese whenever i get a craving to reach for high fat high carb snacks chips buttered popcorn whatever i reach for these and i am satisfied without breaking the budget love them ,1
my daughter has moved into an older home that is a rental she and her roommate have dogs this spring has been unusually warm and it appears that the dogs may have fleas after vaccuuming applying flea protection to the dogs and spraying the carpet and furniture with mycodex the fleas seem to be gone one can did cover the square footage that was listed on the can time will tell how effective everything has worked but the itching and scratching are gone and everyone seems much healthier ,1
the bread will not toast no matter how long you leave it in the toaster the taste was not appealing too sour not a good texture for sandwiches ,0
bitters are making a resurgence these days and i know many bars at least here in nyc are bringing back a properly made cocktail looking at old cocktail books from the and i found that bitters were a key ingredient in many classic cocktails after doing extensive research i learned that regan is made some of the best if not the best orange bitters go to their website and read the story behind this product your other choices are fee brothers and angostura regan is however gets and in my opinion deserves top billing when it comes to orange bitters these bitters are great in a variety of drinks and i usually put two dashes in my old raj martinis although you do not get a strong orange flavor per se you do notice that these bitters subtly enhance the complexity of the drink try these and you will not be disappointed go to regan is website to find literally hundreds of drink recipes that use their bitters you will be inspired to make something more than a boring vodka tonic or gin martini ,1
very disappointing compared to trader joe is or el toro this is inferior great if you want to develop lockjaw or use in a stew that you cook for a few days ,0
the item arrived fast am very pleased with the product when you need just a little paste this is better than wasting a whole can or having another item in the freezer to forget,1
we are big coffee tea drinkers tastes just like sugar no difference we also have the pump which makes it so easy to use ,1
oh convenience you bring me back time and again to products that i should probably know better than to try like the other dozen or so one star reviewers i picked up this mix for some quick brownies and wound up with a full blown gluten reaction bloating pain nausea the whole deal i know this was the source of the problem because i have not had anything new different or strange in a week or so it could not have been the xantham gum because i had a very small portion if the laxative effect is that strong in what would normally be considered a very very small brownie by then too much xantham gum is being used the sad thing is i used my brand new non stick baking pan for this and now have to replace it for the unaware gluten can hang on in plastic silicone and non stick coatings i am just glad i had these after my anaphylacticly allergic child went to bed ,0
when i first go my havanese puppy years ago the breeder suggested these liver treats for using when training my dog will do anything for these treats they even use them at the name brand pet hotel we use in phoenix you have to be careful not to give too much but my dog tanner got over his separation anxiety when i started the routine of asking for a kiss then giving him a treat and then leaving now he just wants the treat i have to beg for the kiss ,1
these are delicous i am partial to the anise but all of the other flavors are good too there are calories per cookie and only of sugar and filling enough so that is enough for a great little treat they are individually wrapped so you do not have to eat the whole box before they go stale unless you want to and the best part is they have chunks of roasted almonds scattered about that are a delight when you hit one ,1
tazo chai is an excellent product and convenient to use however the individual containers can be damaged in transit so be prepared to transer the tea to another container ,1
the first time i tried barilla ricotta spinach tortellini i was hooked on them these are very good i am having trouble finding them on the store shelf in my area and am happy to see that i can order them online i have also purchased barilla tortellini filled with cheese spinach when i was not able to find the ricotta spinach flavor they taste very similar i prefer the ricotta spinach flavor my family can not tell any difference we like to eat them with spaghetti sauce my daughter i eat them in chef salads i have been known to eat them as leftovers cold right out of the refrigerator ,1
i love giving and receiving these lindor truffles assorted gift boxes for the holidays they are delicious bite sized gourmet chocolates that are individually wrapped the wrapping looks like miniature gifts with the sparkly and festive colors that look pretty around the holidays they look almost like miniature christmas tree bulbs with the assorted flavors everyone can find one they like at least and it is fun to sample the different flavors dark chocolate truffles are included and everyone knows now that dark chocolate is good for you chocolate is a vegetable after all chocolate is a bean these seem to have popular appeal even my sons and their friends like them the host hostess can put these out for a party and save some for their family they keep well in the wrapping and are a perfect after dinner mini dessert i find one is enough for a tasty treat if you like chocolate you should enjoy these bite sized chocolate treats ,1
these treats are real tuna steaks grilled and sliced into strips there are no additives no fillers just real tuna packaged conveniently in a resealable pouch see photos above the my picky cat that does not like treats loves my picky dog that loves fish and who also thinks she is a cat loves since this is just pure tuna it is safe for both cats and conveniently and attractively packed in a easy tear resealable pouch and is ideal for traveling or for gift the resealable pouch is not completely the resealable pouch was packaged with some tuna juice on the outside of the seal and so when opening tuna juice gets expensive this is basically a slice of tuna steak in water so a comparable product would be chunk light tuna canned in water at a the price i doubt that whether the tuna is grilled or not would make a difference to the as this is an actual tuna steak sliced into the teats are hard to break into smaller bite sized pieces that one would give their cat or dog it needs to be additionally cut into smaller pieces by fork and knife or with scissors overall a healthy treat that is minimally processed although expensive it would make an ideal gift or special occasion treat ,1
it tasted like slightly flavored watered down coconut water i have had coconut water before and it tasted much better i did not like it ,0
i can almost hear the dogs yelling notreats when this cannister comes out all the dogs absolutely love these treats ,1
i would been looking for an apple preserve and harvest song seemed to fit the bill they have got a wonderfully idyllic print marketing campaign so i thought i would take a chance as it turns out the aluminum lid on the jar has no protective liner my first of a teaspoon was filled with metal the acid in the jam had corroded the interior of the lid producing scratch marks that looked like someone scratched it with the tines of a fork i am calling amazon to see if they will refund on defective food really people run for your lives update i felt a little sick from this product but it cleared up in about hours when i felt better i called amazon through the contact us link near the bottom of the page and received a full refund thanks for the great customer service amazon ,0

i sprout beans and grains in my sprout bag and it is wonderful no mold and no fuss the bag is a good quality bag that will last a long time i am very pleased with it bought,1
this is a good assortment for trick or treaters you usually get approximately pieces per pound but there will be some slight variations bags are usually available from a variety of sources in different weight bags prices vary depending on the source it tends to be in the range of nickle candy alas penny candy is a thing of the past due to inflation ,1
this cereal has no artificial sweetners is high in fiber but has a great taste a hard combination to find ,1
i have had this product before and enjoyed it very much and was so glad to get it from amazon thanks for having this item i have used it on chicken and fish and it was very good i love to dip the bread in it a g new york,1
i have hybrid and exotic cats and love the way they gobble up the wildernes flavors of blue buffalo i order from amazon for ease add the purchase and get free shipping is amazing one day the item did not arrive though ups has stated it had i contacted the vender and they immediately sent a email and re shipped the product as the item had been placed outside for hrs on a humid day and they told me to discard it and use only the fresh item that is great service all the way around add this is a excellent product your kitty is will poo less and it will not stink so bad and they will be so healthy and happy ,1
i bought this pouch along with several other wet cat food brands to see which ones my picky cats who eat more dry food than wet would like and i have to say this one beats the others hands down because it is real shredded chicken pieces in a small amount of liquid my cats could not really tell the difference between this and regular chicken the one benefit this has over regular chicken is that it is a balanced diet that has all the nutrients adult cats need and is aafco approved needless to say it was gone within a minute or two i will need to try weruva is other flavors and get more of the pumpkin lickin chicken for my babies ,1
i have an yr old daughter that loves this stuff i used to be able to pick this up at costco for but think that the product is discontinued in this size so i stocked up ,1
i figured that a dog food made with beef and grilled sirloin steak flavor would smell really good to a dog but i did a little test i put one dog is regular food in a paper bowl and the new food in another paper bowl so that the bowls would not interfere with the test then i put the old food on the floor in its regular place and i put the new food further away the dog smelled her regular food first and then she started sniffing all over in the air until she tracked down the new food she gobbled that up and then ate her regular food the next time i put the new food further away behind the dog food storge container and she tracked it down and ate it first again before eating her regular food i divided the food half and half so it would be her regular amount real beef is our ingredient it says on the bag in the list of ingredients that is followed by soybean meal soy flour and lots of additives including the dyes and corn products etc plus essential vitamins and minerals green beans and potatoes are listed as garnishes there are crunchy kibbles and tender pieces which i am assuming is the beef it is for adult dogs and the product is now made by the nestle purina pet care company a company in switzerland owns the trademarks i trusted purina the instructions say to gradually mix the old regular food with the new which i always do except for the two tests btw while studying the information on the bag and making notes at the dining room table the dogs were all over me one wanted to climb up on the table via my lap fortunately he is short he picked the beef pieces out of his regular food earlier it was mixed together ,1
i liked the jalapeno cheddar better but this one is good also just had to add some hot sauce to it but the taste was good,1
this is the best on salad or as a veggie dip it is a thick dressing so a little goes a long way wish i could get it local ,1
a somewhat decent blended of peaty islay malts the rumor is that it used to contain mostly lagavulin but i do not know if there is any truth to that the fact is the bottler probably buys casks of whatever islay distiller has over produced the result is that the flavors change from bottle to bottle not bad just different a cheaper way to sample the flavors of islay ,0
there are different qualities of bertolli extra virgin olive oil what i purchase from sam is club is bertolli dal notice below the bertolli name in small print the name lucca usually we get what we pay for at best not sure people reference these reviews for advice on nutrition but if you want my opinion i also believe that olive oil rules ,1
when i adopted my second cat it was discovered that she was suffering from some type of food allergy after doing some research i discovered natural balance carried a limited ingredients diet my two cats enjoy the wet and dry food and seem to be doing well on it the prices are very reasonable and i like the fact that natural balance has a buy with confidence feature so that pet owners can monitor the testing of the food they have purchased plus they do not conduct animal testing which a lot of commercial pet foods iams purina nutro do i would highly recommend natural balance ,1
found this in a local health food store but this price is so much better and i save gas not having to drive to the other side of town to get it works great for chocolate milk and i do not feel bad giving it to my kids every day no high fructose corn syrups just all natural ingredients ,1
i made muffins with this and i did not expect them to rise much but this baking mix works great i only added water oil salt an egg splenda baking powder it makes something that tastes like a bran muffin will buy again and it is worth the price ,1
fyi this product says oup kosher for passover on the picture however the product that we received was not certified kosher for passover ,1
i also bought two of these as gifts and will be returning them for the same reason as some of the others unacceptable packaging unless you have already tried the product there is nothing about this that makes you want to try it i assumed big mistake that there would be some kind of packaging but there was not this is really sad too because the product is great ,0
not greasy or salty like a traditional chip these actually tend to be more satiating as a sweet snack than a salty one at least in the sweet potato chip variety a handful of these is a sufficient pick me up and relatively wholesome with just around calories the sugars are low too so even though you feel like you are having something slightly sweet it is really not going to spike your sugars i think around per serving overall these are a great little snack that you can feel good about eating ,1
this stuff is fantastic pack fills you up low in calories and is a healthy snack take the wasabi flavour it has a huge kick ,1
these olives tasted very metallic to me as well as guests for whom i had prepared a couscous salad i will not order them again ,0
this product contains non organic monsatan soy lecithin banned in europe causes cancer and organ failure in lab rats organic sources of soy lecithin are presently available no good reason to use this poison most of the companies that use it have been bought out by the same mega corps that make junk food etc usda organic products are allowed to contain gmos ,0
if you are looking for a flavorful sugar free syrup i would definitly recommend its one of the few that does not seem to have that chemical artificial flavor it is made with splenda i love it the price here is great too if you have amazon prime ,1
started out ok but after a few weeks my dog decided she did not like the taste all that much became picky and would not finish her feedings i ended up discarding a half bag and switching to wellness brand puppy mix canidae does produce very dense dark stools so if you have to pick up poop this makes it easy with a fenced yard i do not bother ,0
i looked for this chocolate flavored product in all grocery stores in my area with no luck found it on amazon this stuff taste great in coffee love it ,1
this was great the mixes arrived and this was the easiest christmas cookies i have made in a long time ,1
this was my first try with bagel spice so i bought the three pack with each of the flavors i love them all they are delightful blends suitable for all sorts of dishes from veggies quesidillas meats etc etc i am a believer ,1
these chocolates were fresh not melted delivered in august and reached us in great shape the order was completed without any concerns i did pay for second day shipping as the vendor recommends by the way the quality of the chocolates was enjoyed by three generations of italians ,1
very good honey at the price i paid for the i will most certainly buy again if you are a fan of pancakes or waffles try them with honey instead of syrup did you know it is also a natural pain reliever as well do the research enjoy ,1
i had high hopes for these based on the other reviews i wanted to like them but i really do not nor do my husband or son to us they taste nothing like real pretzels and are definitely not worth the calories fat or price i know that this is because they lack the gluten but they are not very crunchy more like crisp since they are not dense at all they also have a funky sort of metallic aftertaste ,0
whenever i can find decaffeinated organic and green all in one tea i have won the lottery and to be able to buy a case of it means i do not have to constantly search for it in my local stores this product has the tea bags packaged in groups of bags per sealed pouch that is perfect for me because i use the green tea to brew a pitcher of iced tea it tastes best when i brew it for minutes which is less than the instructions green tea can taste bitter if it is brewed too long ,1
i am a vegetarian but i eat vegan of the time i found these in whole foods because i was looking for some vegan marshmallows to snack on bake with sweet gooey creamy just altogether yummy i am off to buy more ,1
honestly and simply this product was not a good one certainly not good based on my personal experience the beef jerky was so extremely tough and difficult to chew many pieces were so tough that they were literally inedible additionally i ordered the teriyaki jerky and it had a very weak or light flavor ,0
the taste is wonderfully sweet and it does not cause a raise in sugar being newly diagnosed with diabetes this is great news for those times when i crave something sweet i can not use most sweeteners so i really appreciate this and my husband can not tell that i have replaced the sugar with this in recipes i highly recommend it ,1
i was so happy to find this amazon com because our grocery store no longer carries it ,1
first it is paul newman the parmesan and roasted garlic is great on a salad i have put it on chicken and marinated beef strips with it my family also likes it over steamed vegetables i am going back for more meals have gone to humdrum to fab ,1
probably not the healthiest in the nutrition lineup on account of the chocolate covered and honey roasted pieces nonetheless it makes an ideal snack when you are looking for something reasonably nutritious with pronounced flavor i e not light fare ,1
this is a great product and even though the larger cartons are easy to reseal sometimes i just need one cup of stock once opened the contents need to be used up within days i keep both the larger cartons and these small ones on hand at all times ,1
petite cuisine grilled tuna treats cats do not like treats so i am always on this constant search to find treats that maybe they will like and then i will teach them to do the tango or something i am hazy on that part but anyway i was thrilled when this packet came in the mail the cats had their noses in the air and were meowing at me before i had the mail packet open this tuna smells good and it must taste good too since they were nose deep in it immediately and chowed down so i can vouch that my kitties loved the taste of this treat everything else about the treat seems odd to me though for starters these are not treats in the here is a little nibble sense there are three slabs of tuna in here and while i guess you could pick them into tiny pieces and give slivers to the cats they look like they are meant to be eaten as a whole meal and they are really big one of my cats skipped dinner later after having this snack and the chubby always hungry one looked askance at the treat halfway through like she was getting full and was not sure what to do about it so i would recommend not serving a whole stick to the cats but breaking it into pieces the problem here is that it is not really easy to get the packet open the resealable part of the packet would not open for me at all so i had to cut the packet open and tuna juice got everywhere then the first stick broke in half when i was sliding it out and i could not easily reach in and get the rest without breaking the other sticks eventually i just crumbled everything up and served it in handfuls and that seemed to work but was pretty messy you probably can not use these for training in the end my cats liked the treat but i wonder if they would not have liked just as much a small can of tuna from the store since this was basically a tuna meal i think if you wanted to replace their meals with the occasional treat like this this would be a great buy but if you are wanting little nibblers for the cats to train with pass this by note this review is based on a free advance review copy of this product provided through amazon vine ana mardoll,1
i made excellent pie crust with mochiko sweet rice flour which was recommended by a recipe i had the crust was tender moist and flaky it was so tender that it broke easily but i was able to manage it by rolling it out on plastic wrap and the taste was to die for ,1

i am from west bengal india i grew up with finest quality darjeeling and assam tea i never got such good tea here in the us all the glowing reviews made me buy this tea thinking that i would at last find a good tea the tea is simply horrible i am not sure how the other buyers are making this tea but this tea is far from strong and it has no flavor two packs of simple lipton tea make a better cup do not waste your money on this one ,0
first of all celestial seasonings makes great tea i use a combination of to tangerine orange zinger to pomegranate pizzazz bigelow add sweetener to taste and everyone loves it it tastes more like punch ,1
this item looks very good in the picture but does not even look closer to the description there is no tray but an ugly plastic wrapped package very disappointed and want to return it and not buy from this reseller ,0

the sport beans are awesome i trained for a running race this summer and taking the beans with me on my longer runs really helped sustain my energy they are easy to take along and very easy to eat they break down nicely in your mouth and are easily digested the flavors are tasty so you do not cringe when eating them during a hard run also it is a jelly bean what better texture i just moved to a tropical climate hawaii and can not find them in stores here i need them to help with my training since it is so hot the electrolytes and vitamins will really make a difference planning on buying them on amazon ,1
i bought bags of this product for my daughters party she is so excited she loves jelly bellys and the deal i got made it affordable ,1
i ordered this coffee after reading reviews on amazon usually those reviews are really helpful but not in this case the coffee does not have a nice taste it is not better than any grocery store brand it is flavor is strong but not in a good way rather like badly roasted coffee i know some people like fruity acidic flavor and some like nutty flavor like me in their coffee but melitta coffee has neither it is more like coffee flavored mud on top of all i was not able to return the coffee because it turns out amazon does not allow returns on some grocery items if you doubt my review because of all other glorifying reviews well when i ordered this coffee there was not even a single negative review that is the way i was fooled however if you do not care much about the quality of coffee but just need caffeine this coffee may be right choice for you if you care about the taste of your coffee at all avoid melitta even for this price trust me it does not worth ,0
i have been cutting back on my salt intake and thought this product would be good however it contains soooo much black pepper it is the first ingredient listed on the label i can not use much to season my food because the black pepper is overwhelming and then the food is too spicy and bothers my stomach i can not recommend this product ,0
my husband and i have tried many olive oils both imported and domestic pricey and inexpensive trader joe is california estate olive oil is by far the best tasting if you have access to a trader joe is store it is less expensive there ,1

this is the order of ez sweetz i have ordered i have tried them all this is as close as you can get to sugar i order the small bottles because it is more concentrated caution do not over sweeten with it add a drop at a time believe me sometimes all that is needed is drop i know hard to believe but trust me easier to add more than regret adding too much i have been making amazing lemonade tea similar to diet snapple half and half here is the recipe it is great just about given up soda all envelope crystal light lemonade mix makes oz add the required water then lemon squeezedmix this together and add additional ez sweetz to taste i like mine on the sweet side next i take regular tea bags and put in the microwave with c water cook on high for mins let steep about mins remove tea bags add this to enough water to fill a oz pitcher again sweeten to your taste with ez sweetz now mix tea with lemonade so you wind up with oz total of diet snapple half and half just adjust to your taste enjoy ,1
i wanted to get some rice just plain rice not parboiled not enriched just rice well try walking into your local market and finding that anything that was just plain rice was ridiculously expensive i like to support our local co op but i also can not afford to pay what they charge for organic rice at least on a regular basis my first choice for rice would usually be basmati or jasmine this rice is just what it says it is fragrant plain jasmine rice my wife and i love it my kids love it so that is all that matters we have a small rice cooker and it is a no brainer turns our perfect every time ,1
i tried this because of the price difference and i have not regretted it for a moment this product can measure up to any i have tried and i am making this a staple for my kitchen my linguine a la parmigiana have received rave reviews with this new addition ,1
it is a bit pricey with shipping but i bought this because this brand has unusual colors i needed purple for a king cake and here in illinois you just can not find purple sugar i actually like this brand quite a bit and would recommend it the colors are nice and bright compared to some cheaper brands i have seen the first thing i noticed however is that the sugar crystals are large compared to the near shavings i get from the colored sugars i got at the local grocery store i guess i will have to go buy the green and gold ones too so they match next time ,1
there are flavors in the annie chun ramen house lineup and i recently tried this one and the soy ginger flavor the ramen house lineup includes a packet of pre cooked noodles that are non fried and low fat they come soft unlike the hard brick that usually comes with ramen there is also a liquid soup packet this particular flavor i found to be somewhat bland the noodles are cooked perfectly and are a good consistency the soup is not spicy at all if you added some tofu vegetables scallions etc you can make a more filling meal out of it i added some soy sauce and it improved the taste considerably my recommendation is to go with the much better but not vegetarian soy ginger flavor it is also vegetarian includes a few vegetables a bowl to cook everything in and is my favorite if you are not vegetarian id try the other flavors first but this flavor is still decent especially when other ingredients are added a little hot sauce would probably liven it up quite a bit it also has a very reasonable amount of sodium compared to similar products its shelf stable and easy to make with either boiling water or a microwave i pay about in my local grocery the amazon vendors often hike up the price where its not worth buying online if you are looking for other vegetarian vegan soup options similar to ramen another brand to look for is thai kitchen and simply asia they offer some excellent rice noodle bowls and soups that are also gluten free as well ,1
we love this granola i use to eat bare naked almond granola but it was so sugary and it was not gluten free udi is is delicious and with subscribe save it is cheaper on amazon then at the grocery store ,1
these are the best granola bars you will ever have i think i am addicted to them they are absolutely wonderful d with little fat and little calories tasty too in each bar and being organic these are awesome the choco chip ones are really good and are my favorite ,1
love this stuff its my favorite seasoning for french fries unfortunately its hard to find near me and when i can find it i only can find the small jar which never lasts long finding a huge canister like this on amazon was just the thing can now use it on everything without fear of running out try it on your fries trust me ,1
i keep a few of these in my desk at work for days when i do not feel like going out to lunch they are super convenient because you can microwave them as is just tear open slightly to vent and put in the microwave no bowl required just a spoon or in a pinch tilt your head back and slurp it the taste is great i love indian food and i love vegetables so this is perfect for me the only thing to mention is that one of my co workers complained about the smell but he is that sorta complainy person who does not eat indian food and prefers burger king it tastes great smells great and is super convenient ,1
this is the best home brew for espresso i have come across lately i can not find it at my grocer how dare they and i bought the dark roast starbucks there and ground it when i made it yesterday it tasted so bland in comparison la llave rocks ,1
i never thought i would say i love oatmeal but here i am saying just that this stuff is just fantastic i had not heard of steel cut oats but when amazon offers a great deal i have to check it out bargain hunting it is a gift and a curse i did the research and was amazed at all i found about the health benefits of steel cut oats i was greatly encouraged by the rave reviews on amazon but i admit a bit skeptical i mean really it is just oatmeal right wrong i bought this product and the quick cooking variety as well i am hooked on this product i am usually not one to plan ahead but i make a big batch of this at the beginning of the week portion it out into covered bowls and have it for breakfast everyday i love the chewy texture and nutty flavor i have made it with water milk and organic apple juice my favorite is half water half apple juice with pecans dried cranberries and cinnamon so delicious and filling however one of the things i love about buying this basic product is being able to mix it up however i like yes the cans arrived dented but the oatmeal was intact so it did not bother me a bit i did find the same product at my local publix for a can which is cheaper than the amazon price however since i have prime the shipping is free and i will probably subscribe to the auto ship on this product which does lower the price to less than my local store plus no tax and tennessee does love their taxes on food items but if amazon offers another amazing deal on it i will not hesitate to stock up and get only the long cooking version this time i definitely recommend this product and will be pestering my mom and sisters to get some too i know they will love it and it is so good for them ,1
these are without a doubt the best doggie treats ever all natural no additives no chemicals made in the usa they are just dried liver my dachshunds will do nearly anything to get them and that includes trying to climb the counter to get to the bag i even get them for my grand dogs one of which has digestive troubles and has a special diet these are the only treats she can eat without problems they are the best ,1
we are very happy with this products probably this is ons of the best tea with chamomile we would recommend it to everyone ,1
i purchased these along with a few other packages from jack links these are pretty good products it is great to have a pretzel cheese and the beef stick at once i will definately purchase more in the future ,1
i saw an earlier ad today from this seller daily market offering king arthur bread flour in a lb bag for i was sort of suspicious about this because i have never seen kaf bread flour in anything more than a bag so i contacted king arthur flour co about this basically what they indicated is that their bread flour is available in various combinations of lb bags but if it is a lb it is not legitimate as kaf does not package their bread flour in anything larger than lb bags ,0
i spent dollares for a tiny box of cookies and some pc samples this is the biggest rip off ,0
what you see is what you get not a stunning variety but adequate there are each of four different kinds tullys french roast caribou blend newmans blend and green mountain nantucket blend nothing out of the ordinary or exciting but a solid way to restock a collection with some variety for different tastes ,1
product is so so so amazing we even bought it for a friend and the price is great also will be ordering all the time ,1
their banana bread bar is definitely one of the tastier bars in the market for those who like the taste of bananas the texture is perfect for a soft juicy biteas for the nutrition the ingredients used are wholesome and even the fat content comes from almonds fruit this has become my staple breakfast for most work days,1
i ordered this a month or so ago as a bereavement gift wanting the family to have something other than the arboretum of slowly dying flowers one usually gets at a time like that it was very well received and greatly appreciated and as i was told very delicious what i initially thought might be odd for the occasion turned out to be the perfect gift ,1
my kids love these if i let them they would eat a day we have ordered these from amazon probably over times and have never had a bad batch ,1
i thought these were more like pasta than rice in fact they seem just like orzo except are easier to make and have almost no carbs i have been a big fan of miracle noodle but this one is even better they still stink though so beware after soaking in boiling water for minute the smell is gone ,1
i would tried taste of the wild bison venison about a month back for my first time the first bag was great the dogs loved it and everything went well i ordered a second bag about a month later i have a red heeler puppy about and a year old jrt blue heeler on it when i opened the bag it had a very strong smell much stronger than the first bag i had not thought much of it until after the dogs ate the puppy got sick after eating his first bowl of the second bag he was whimpering a lot and just could not keep anything down and my has been having serious gas and diarrhea now they both will not touch the stuff i picked up a bag of some other stuff at the local petsmart and they are both eating fine so i am not sure if there are some quality control issues or i just got a bad bag but i will be trying something else ,0
great taste enjoy it in the evening when i am trying to avoid caffeine i am able to offer a variety of choices when guests come over without making a full pot of coffee k cups are easy and convenient ,1
this is my favorite decaf k cup thus far and the price on amazon is the best except when half the cups break in the keurig i have not experienced this with any of my other amazon k cup orders and it is probably just a bad batch of k cups but since i have seen other comments about this problem as well i thought i should add to it to warn customers and hopefully encourage timothy is to better their quality control ,0
fast and good it beats having to stand over a stove to prepare indian cooking ,1
this is a great no salt seasoning option my husband is on a restricted sodium diet and finding seasonings and food items is tough we use this on all of our grilling items came quickly and in great shape ,1
i have enjoyed the intense flavor versatility and healthful benefits of cocoa nibs for many years these nibs from navitas are of consistently high quality and i recommend them to anyone who is looking for nibs nibs may be used to make chocolate i use them for a wide range of culinary purposes including crunchy addition to yogurt berries desserts ground with coffee beans for coffee i sometimes incorporate them into sauces if i am not feeling lazy i like to cook but i tend to stick to simple things without sauces unless you grind these things only eat them if you are certain of the strength of your teeth as they are hard the flavor and aroma are mindful of chocolate but unlike chocolate there is no sugar and they have a bitter finish i like it but your experience may vary ,1
this great product is easy to use and carry with you it is small in size dispenses easily and fits well in pocket or purse ,1
i ordered this rice on a whim i am so happy i did it has a wonderful aroma when it is cooking it fluffs up nice and has a great flavor and texture the package size is quite handy all in all i am totally happy with my purchase and will reorder ,1
this is amazing tasting vanilla and contrary to what others are saying it does not contain artificial vanilla vanillin is the crystalline substance that forms on the outside of the beans as they ferment there is also an artificial vanillin but that is not what is contained here the following quote is from the joy of baking the beans are first plunged into hot water and then the wouldrying and isweating process starts the beans are dried in the sun during the day and then wrapped in the blankets at night so they can sweat this process can last anywhere from to months until the beans become a very dark brown color and develop a white crystalline substance or frost on the outside of the bean called vanillin the vanillin is what gives the beans their wonderful flavor and aroma and these beans are prized so please disregard these other bad reviews and try this it is a steal ,1
i was so excited for this to arrive because i love orgain drinks and this has two benefits over orgain the first benefit is the drink is larger in size oz versus oz and it has a twist off cap that you can put back on which orgain does not this unfortunately is where the benefits end for this product orgain tastes so much better and also has more vitamins in it i do not know if it is the soy milk or what but the taste of this is absolutely horrible it is like a bad medicine after taste i purchased this because of all of the positive reviews on amazon and because of the packaging versus orgain i was really hoping this would be great but i now have eleven containers of this stuff that i will never drink i cannot stress how bad this was to me but maybe you will like it since so many others do i wish that i would have purchased an individual bottle before buying a whole case but that was my own fault for not doing so do not make the same mistake i did ,0
i am a true chocoholic and enjoy american chocolates watchamacallit and kit kat are by far the best two i recommend this one very much ,1
i love this water i feel so much better when i drink it i feel more hydrated and energized i can tell the difference after a week when i am without it my skin yells at me ,1
menadione sodium bisulfite complex source of vitamin k is a severely toxic synthetic form of vitamin k can cause severe liver damage and carrageenan as well i would never feed my cat that food ,0
tastes and smells great most bestest coffee everz only downside is that its about times more expensive than your typical generic blends ,1
i would say compare to the mm brand giving the same supply but this one just too hard for me to drink it taste horrible ,1
these bulk peanuts are not salted and very tasty the shelf life of these peanuts lasted very long about weeks so do not worry about them going stale comparable products are salted and more expensive ,1
very good and so easy i made plain peppermint and pecan so much easier and in some cases better than the old fashioned way ,1
if you own this you have to get one of these drawers very handy keeps everything neat and tidy doesnt take up anymore space the rubber makes the machine quieter love it ,1
i just ordered this and made my kids and waffle lovers the most delicious gf waffles we have tried so many mixes and most of them are good albeit a little grainy not pamela is there is no graininess at all just a delicious texture that no one would recognize as gluten free ca not wait to try this mix to make scones for my hubs this weekend the pamela is website has tons of recipes that use this mix as a base ,1
how many cans and what size are the cans poor description my cat loves the food but what is being offered here ,1
my parents used to drink cherry almond tea all the time and they being completely useless on the internet were living with the assumption that this tea no longer existed because they could not buy it anywhere locally needless to say since it arrived we have been drinking a lot of tea it is amazing it smells delicious tastes delicious we all love it when this box runs out i am getting another one ,1
all my life i have avoided canned anchovies because they taste horrible i read some wonderful things about this sauce on the internet but it is made from anchovies i considered it a real gamble to order a bottle of the red boat fish sauce wow this stuff is tasty and the flavor is so intense i do not know anything about asian cooking but this sauce is truly nectar of the gods a few drops of the fish sauce will add a truck load of flavor to your seafood dishes i use it to reinforce the flavor of fish with a milder taste i am finding it to be a very versatile flavor enhancer yesterday i composed a dressing for a green salad a few drops of fish sauce whipped into a little olive oil and rice vinegar produces a nice savory dressing as a another reviewer noted this is a finishing sauce i add it after the food is cooked i believe the quality of the sea salt in this product makes a huge difference if you want to add a savory flavor to your dishes give it a try p s i still hate canned anchovies ,1
one of our favorite treats especially on the go and it is good for you one of these fruit ropes meets the daily requirement for a piece of fruit obviously it is best to eat fresh fruit if you do not have the time or have a little one who is picky then these are great mixed berry and strawberry are my favorites with just the right mix of sweet and tart personally i can not stand the sour apple but luckily my kid likes it looking forward to trying all of the other flavors ,1
this plant is beautiful and the packaging was also great a lot of new leaves are growing beautifuly i recommend this as gift to a love one or as a sign of friendship to last ,1
for those who like are feeding their dogs the raw food diet these bites may something you could use for treats there is nothing artificial in the ingredients as listed on the box chicken turkey turkey liver turkey heart pumpkinseeds apples carrots ground chicken bone butternut squash ground flaxseeds montmorillonite clay broccoli lettuce spinach dried kelp apple cider vinegar parsley honey salmon oil olive oil mixed tocopherols with citric acid rosemary blueberries alfalfa sprouts persimmons inulin sage and clove this treat is labeled for dogs and cats but i have large dogs pound labs and these treats were finished in less than seconds for large dogs i think this may work out better as a training treat they are easy to break into pieces there are in a package about the size of a silver dollar and about inch thick they have the consistency of freeze dried food and were very quickly eaten by my labs all loved it but for the size of my dogs it is an expensive treat ,1
quaker soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies taste closest to homebaked cookies than any others i have tried my kids loved them too they are moist and flavorful we like them as a snack or even as a breakfast on the go ,1
i do not know how this company dares to label this as chocolate fudge brownie as it tastes absolutely nothing like that a lot of so called flavored coffees have disappointingly little of the flavor they have supposedly added to the coffee but this one had none at all it did not even smell like the titled flavor what is worse other flavored coffees with disappointingly little of the flavor they supposedly added at least still taste like decent coffee this one does not i even tried mixing it with some folgers coffee to use it up and noticed it brought down the quality of the folgers brew please save yourself from this distasteful experience and purchase something else ,0
perhaps i am not a connoisseur of chinese food but my wife and i like this mustard very much with egg rolls we have had some mustards that are so pungent they will clear your sinuses when you eat them this mustard tends to be at the lower end of that unofficial scale if you are really looking for something that is extra hot by everyone is measure this might not be the one for you i live in a state where we eat a lot of mexican food and most people in the country do not like food as hot as it is typically made here what we think of as hot other people across the country think of as unbearable using this as my point of reference i think that if you are an average american in terms of your taste for hot food this mustard is likely to provide a nice level of heat and spiciness ,1
my dog love it they were having loose stools and stomach issues since switching my dogs to nature is variety instinct dog food all their issues have been resolved they also seem more energetic and active even my old golden retriever this is great food and i will be purchasing large bags per month ,1
very high quality love to use it in my bread baking equal to king arthur quality but better price this is for baking only ,1
i can handle very hot stuff but wow this stuff is strong the guy above me who said use the eye dropper was smart i shouldve listened to him this stuff isnt a joke its not something to let anyone eat straight from the bottle its just too hot it should be used as a food additive only the reason i say that you need an eye dropper is because it is incredibly runny and you dont want to put in more than you can handle it has an incredible flavor i used small drop of the mad dog pepper extract and a pinch of crushed naga jolokia into a pound pot of chili and had to drain some of the heat out of it which is incredibly difficult and it still stayed pretty hot its very good and very hot use with caution,1
 begin update just received my case of in a little over but then again i have been sharing for sharing w my taste buddies while the remaining is have been for my own taste buds i added little steamed won tons today but it was more than this soup needed maybe tomorrow a sliced hard boiled egg keeping it simple is the best way to enjoy this bowl of ramen wherein the broth is superior i will let you know if i ever get on to trying the other flavors as i would originally hoped thanks for reading end update if you ever enjoyed add hot water and wait bowl type instant ramen this has in my humble opinion the best tasting broth no contest of this type that i have ever had since cup jorick came along early is fast forward for the last year or so i have enjoyed the nong shim big bowl noodle udon still do since it is not spicy at all allowing me to add spice if i choose to change it up add steamed won tons char siu you get the idea menraku tonkotsu ramen while the noodles are on par w instant ramen of the bowl variety here it is the rich broth that immediately upon tasting is set apart from the usual within the category other reviewers here who have also enjoyed have picked up the same flavorful aspects buttery a bit of garlic a rich tasting broth like you could only get home made or in the best kept secret asian restaurants i look forward to trying the other menraku varieties shio ramen miso ramen and shoyu ramen all very basic flavors that can be lost causes in the wrong hands but i am convinced on this experience alone though tonkotsu ramen may be my new all time favorite that i will enjoy the others as well wondered about tonkotsu pork bone not to be confused w tonkatsu breaded pork cutlet as the broth did not convey much pork taste though it could be usual japanese subtlety at play here i got this on wed and i have had one each day since i should get another case soon as i know i will be sharing currently living in a dorm buy the case stash it however you are best able or split the case w others it is quick easy and great value amazon prime got it here in two days the only thing left to say is itadakimasu ,1
this was the time that we tried these and we all liked them we will absolutely buy these again ,1
i am not sure what the other reviewers were expecting out of this i have had a lot of microwavable noodles and this is one of the better brands if you are looking for americanised teriyaki chicken or something like that you are not going to get that here these are noodles with teriyaki sauce one of the things i like about kame is that the noodles are pre cooked they are stored in a moisture pouch with oil so all you have to do is heat them up cooking tip do not worry about seperating the noodles straight away just remove them from the pouch push them to the bottom and pour the sauce over then wait for it to be heated before stiring seperating the noodles it makes it much easier ,1
a very delicious treat for all our party guest who asked for more serve with coffee ice cream or just by itself easy to get through the amazon connection ,1
the package came on time and had everything that i ordered but the chocolate on the milk duds looks like it was old and was dried out and white ish not happy,0
i have amazing cyber friends in west hollywood who highly recommended the griddle cafe is red velvet pancakes they tweeted a picture of their brunch and i was sold the next day i packed up my husband and we took off on our round trip to get the pancakes they were everything they were cracked up to be we considered seconds but the nearby la brea tar pits beckoned and we were full now i do not need to drive to get the world is best pancakes the mix is delivered to my door i just add water and cream cheese icing the recipe is on the canister and these light fluffy pancakes all mine if you are worried the very sweet cream cheese icing is perfect for breakfast brunch since the pancakes themselves are not all that sweet i purchased the mix for five friends this christmas i know they are as happy with their yummy results as i am with mine by the way you can order the griddle cafe is buttermilk pancake mix right here too ,1
this is a good refreshing product you do not need much to use in a fry pan but the only thing i noticed is that it is like wax i thought it w be like how it is explaned on page an oil oils pour out and this does not you have to use a knife or hard spoon to get out but i must tell you i did like how it tastes as long as it is cooked w something i broke up pieces of flour tortilla in just a regular frypan frying till i liked it chrunchy crisp then put on paper towel to absorb any extra oil then powdered mmmm it hit the spot it made such a simple item into a great tasting snack for my cravings have not used long enough to tell if it is a energy booster all in all except for the waxiness of it it does fry things good dottie t erie,1
as an iced tea addict i am always looking for a nice black tea with a lot of flavor great aroma without the bitter taste you get from a lot of off the shelf brands first thing i noticed about this tea was the size and shine of the leaves the leaves are good sized and all the oils are there brewed it has a nice clarity no cloudiness and i make it by the gallon even with an minute brew time i like strong tea its not bitter just full of flavor hot or iced it has really impressed me with all the subtle flavors involved the high end caffeine kick is nice too well worth the cost of shipping ,1
i used a lot of this mix adding all sorts of things and made in small cakes for each batch it made wonderful gifts i had bought it locally and so pleased to find it on amazon ,1
i ordered these a gift so i have not tried them however the three people who did eat them were raving they also arrived at their destination very very quickly this seller is great she answered my allergen questions speedily and i will continue to order from leiilalove ,1
going gluten free is not easy however there are plenty of options that will get you close to eating traditional bread this is not one of them the cooking process is pretty accurate on the box the dough mix is almost pure liquid so you will need a pizza pan in my case i used a cookie sheet which was deep enough to not slosh over you cook the liquid mixture for minutes or so pull it out puncture the air holes and then cook some more toppings go on last and just long enough to melt the final product was almost inedible the dough is tough and chewy it does not cut without a knife because of the cookie sheet a pizza cutter would not get the edges and we had to push so hard to get through the fake bread leather that i dented the cookie sheet and destroyed it however the taste is worse than the texture the herbs and the mix itself make an almost bitter tasting dough the taste is just awful the crust crisped a little around the edges but was still tough there are better options out there try udi is rudi is or glutino products either as already prepared pizza or already prepared crust if you have a mellow mushroom in town try their pizza they are careful about cross contamination just do not get this one ,0
we tried this pasta on a whim when grocery shopping one day no one in our family eats a gluten free diet or anything it was purely an impulse buy wow was this a good purchase i fed our whole family including teenagers with this one bag and we had a lot leftover it is of such high quality that it filled everyone up on less than traditional white pasta and they could not stop talking about how good it taste i used this brand is mini shells for a dish a few nights ago and again they couldn t say enough about how good it was this will now be our pasta of choice as the flavor and value because less fills up everyone from now on ca not say enough ,1
this is my favorite bagged tea with a little half and half and a couple sugars this tea makes a strong authentic indian spiced chai i use this as an alternative when i can not have my own homemade chai mix ,1
my wife was mad because i bought this she thought i was buying more crap from amazon she changed her mind after we made it and tasted it it is easy to make and comes out thicker than what you get at a restaurant it is very tasty and i think that even though she can make this stuff from scratch she would rather use this product going forward ,1
i did not purchase this from amazon but did have a chance to purchase a bag of these chips from a low carb store in santa fe springs california these chips are light very crunchy and really good i am on a diet and i miss eating crunchy chips i like the dill sour cream flavor ,1

golden malted waffle mix is the best on the market for making waffles i give it as a gift whenever i hear a friend or family member is looking for a good mix they all rave about the flavor ,1
i live in oregon and it did arrive quickly alive and vigorous i have been using it for breakfast waffles every morning since and am keeping it on my counter i highly recommend this starter for first time sourdough bakers i would tried to catch my own culture twice and had also mail ordered a free one that took over a month to arrive when i was tired of failing and of waiting i got this and was up and running less than a week later with a strong healthy aged culture totally worth with shipping to get plugging along ,1
about out of every disks is bad to my knowledge there is no reasonable recourse tassimo will not pay to have the product shipped back if the original post office package has been opened how do you know a product is inferior if you do not open it tassimo refused to credit my credit card for unordered merchandise while their website was under revision refused to pay for unordered return package because the outside envelope had been opened so i could see what was inside etc i am stuck with the coffee maker until it no longer works their customer service was argumentative and their responses to my problems were not uniform resulting in serious delays confusion ,0
these tapioca pearls are fantastic they cook quickly and are a fantastic addition to bubble teas or any sweet tea ,1
i received my assortment package today i am extremely pleased the outer package was marked with an expiration date of which is a non issue for me many of the k cups were individually marked with expiration dates well beyond that all k cups were in fine shape with no broken ones i received a total of different flavored cups there were each of flavors and singles a good assortment of great flavors i will most certainly be ordering again ,1
i like this coffee but it definitely needs a sweetner to give it that umpf you can taste the pumpkin and the nutmeg all spice in this one ,1
big size cashews with salt taste good but still percent of the wholes seeds is spare parts i and my daughter all like it very much ,1
i love kashi products and this is one of my favorites of their cereals i like to mix a couple of their brands for a high fiber low fat breakfast i can eat at a m and be fine untill p m i have it almost everyday especially good with sliced fresh strawberries ,1
i signed up for the reoccuring monthly shipment of the oz vita coco both the peach mango and pineapple flavors i am very happy with the product itself however i only received boxes out of the advertised i would beware about buying the reoccuring shipments as you might not get everything you ordered i am not able to return the product and am trying to find out how to report this to amazon in the correct way buyer beware ,0
the bitterness in this tea is way too strong and the flavor weak it leaves a strange bad taste on the sides on my mouth when i drink it plain it is only really drinkable with milk and sugar or iced with sugar instead i would recommend trying a nice looseleaf black tea failing that try lipton is black pearl if you want a decent bagged tea that is easy to find twinings prince of wales is another good bagged tea btw orange pekoe does not refer to the flavor of the tea it refers to the size of the tea leaf pieces strangely orange pekoe is used for large pieces whereas this tea contains smaller pieces yielding more bitterness i am not sure why they use this term ,0
when i opened this matcha the smell was amazing but then every one of red leaf matcha smells amazing this one though i wanted to do something different with instead of my typical matcha latte i wanted something more eye opening more sparkly more vibrant so today i made something with italian sparkling water low fat all natural vanilla creamer and matcha this is my take on an italian cream soda now of course i tasted the matcha before making my blended drink and you know what it was quite good it was a tad bitter but my water to matcha ratio was a bit off as i intentionally made this one a bit thicker to get my blend where i wanted it to be but alas it was in fact grape all the way i am thinking purple grapes everyone tends to have a favorite grape but this seemed purple all the way grape is not normally a flavor i go for unless we are speaking of an ice wine or something similar i do love wine infused teas but as a rule grape matcha was not one i would gravitate toward but i got this one because i wanted to test not only the matcha but my own limits i figure if i love this flavor of matcha then there is no way red leaf can go wrong with any of their flavors and so far they have not and trust me i have tired a lot of their flavors so here i sit with a sparkly vibrant creamy grape matcha that has not lost any of its base qualities or flavors from the matcha powder itself due to all the insane things i have mixed with it that to me friends says this matcha is supreme ,1
i would never ever ever buy this gum again not sure what extra was trying to accomplish here but i would advise you to buy a pack in store before purchasing it in bulk i am a gum lover i would not chew this if it were free it tastes chemically no identifiable flavor just ick ,0
i mistakenly ordered a gallon of this olive salad and was at first dismayed but after trying it i knew it would not be a problem to use it up it is great tastes very fresh and is so versatile i use it in tuna salad pasta salad on top of tossed salads and mixed with mayo as a sandwich spread with the holidays coming up i plan on a big muffaletta sandwich to take to a party as well as mixing the salad with cream cheese for a cracker spread this is a keeper ,1
this is a very strong roast and a great morning coffee if you need your eyeballs popped open in a hurry i would strongly suggest using the largest cup size when brewing this kcup i used quite a bit of sweetener and threw in some cocoa powder which really enhanced the flavor and actually made the coffee much smoother next time i will use even more milk to further dilute the flavor this coffee would be a great base for cappucino frappucino etc etc i picked this up at bed bath beyond for with off coupon it is also available at target and safeway ,1
i love this cocoa i discovered it several years ago at a local grocery store since finding it on amazon i have always had it in stock in my pantry if you bake alot ordering a case is definitely worth it the cocoa is much richer darker and tastier than any other i have found ,1
experienced the taste of this product in germantown oh since then every few months i purchase this wonderful product in lieu of potato chips and cookies ,1
i really dont understand why people dont like these bars it has organic dates oats chia seeds and cashews which is a great combination i think its a little less sweet for most peoples liking plus it is soft and love the strawberry seeds mixed with dates texture my husband and child are more into junk food so i knew they would not appreciate it i am still hoping this grows on my son coz its is seriously healthy and would work great for lunch boxes i think its not the typical commercial junk thats really tasty with no nutrition but its very nutritious with a little less taste all in all i would say out of love these bars i think these are a great snack bars in between meals and i really am stuck on these ,1
put this on your frozen pizzas prior to cooking and they will taste twice as good i also mix it in with breakfast potatoes and other fried stuff it is just a great mix of flavors mrs dash has the right combo ,1
wow you can stop looking around all over the internet you can stop bugging great grandma for her recipe you can stop driving all over town looking for a better bakery if you are bummed because your friend just lost pounds and you did not put this on their desk and just walk away this is as authentic as it gets item was received in excellent shape i was able to cut my first piece right in it is container you do have to be careful lots of deep chocolate flavor not bitter you could easily pass this off as home made i do not think i could make one as good as this i would give it stars if it was an option ,1
while i did not at any time imagine that i was eating a real piece of pie the flavor of real cherries is there not too many ingredients so i did not have to worry about allergies it caused no stomach distress during bicycle riding ,1
love love love this snack but i live in georgia and the chocolatey bits were all melted when it arrived i would reorder in cooler weather tho ,1
this sauce is so good ordered it and it arrived days later intact and not a one missing plus the delivery guy was cute xd rotfl this sauce tastes good on anything fried and really scrumdiddliumptious on pizza definitely worth the bucks i give it a bajillion out of only because it is that good the delivery guy was cute ,1

i looked for a long time for a healthy cat food that didnt cost a ton of money with it being gone within a month this cat food had a good price for a pound bag not to mention it lasts a long time probably months the food does so well with my cats and no more diarrhea for them either they like it and it does very well on their tummies i would recommend it previously i used wellness indoor and it caused diarrhea i dont know why the other reviewer said bad things maybe it wasnt the food definitely buy ,1
this product is an excellent source of energy and good tasting too i try not to run out i do not use it that often but only when i think i really need it sometimes to continue on with my day after leaving my job ,1
i do not know who at amazon does the math for the prices of each piece but whoever it is needs some lessons six pouches of for does not make each treat,1
i am gluten intolerant and a friend introduced these bars to me in august they are absolutely awesome filling so tasty not like most of the gluten free cardboard tasting things we sometimes get ,1
senseo is a wonderful product the coffee is absolutely delicious i have encouraged all my friends to purchase this ,1
the title sums it up the fern was withered when i opened it up did not make it a week tried nursing it back with no luck ,0
senseo sumatra blend neither smells nor tastes like true sumatra mandheling it tastes more like a stronger barely breakfast blend with an acidic aftertaste this is a bland boring characterless coffee in addition the senseo pods are very thin with very little coffee in them causing a very weak brew even on the oz setting for a much better sumatra mandheling stick to java one or molto ,0
at the time i bought santa fe refrito the idea of less than can sized portions was new to me i would cover of a can with plastic wrap and a rubber band refrito can have a high dose of sodium so i would not over do it santa fe dry refrito can be made in any size portion in my case directly in a microwave in a cup food storage container since this purchase i have noticed the availability of similar products in the bulk foods section of fred meyer with even lower sodium concentrations ,1
first of all i will not be buying the aregular size sunflower seeds again only the jumbo sized seeds the little ones are too much work and too little reward the flavor of these dill sunflower seeds reminds me of a dill pickle and i do not get a sore mouth from the excessive salt additives as i do with david brand sunflower seeds the jumbo brand seeds are fresh and i do not get loads of broken empty shells in the packages anyway i do recommend these over the david brand of sunflower seeds ,1
i bought this as it came in a pack with the mascara and as it turned out i liked it more than the mascara it is great stuff it smells to me like baking cookies every time i put it on my husband asks me if i am baking something it has such a yummy smell it is so smooth and goes on great i recommend this product for anyone looking for a good face cream ,1
huge fan of this crystal light flavor i usually find crystal light drink mixes to be rather concentrated so i mix one packet with oz of water and it comes out just right not too sweet the color of the mixed drink is also easy on the eyes it is a pale green color so nothing like the bright red blue purple orange colors that some of the other drink mix flavors will give you ,1
we like the product but when it was shipped the boxes all came smashed which damaged the plastic and some of the product spilled out not sure i will ever order it from here again ,1
if you are used to the kick of standard insanity or total insanity then this will be quite disappointing from a heat perspective has a decent taste to it kind of a garlic limey flavor but not spicy in the least goes well with soups and salads i have found ,1
we were first introduced to twinings when we lived in australia for a year and one half as uncultivated americans for us tea was tea we learned otherwise in the company of those who knew now twinings english breakfast tea is all we will buy it does not have the bitter taste common in most teas as the aussies say it is smooth ,1
i buy bag a month for my indoor dogs and they love it all nutritious ingredients no junk corn wheat fillers only thing i add is salmon oil i highly recommend even my malinoiis loves this ,1
i have ordered the snackmasters salmon jerky a number of times and have never been disappointed with the quality until today my co workers and i like to have a little salty treat in our otherwise very sugary snack station so i have taken to ordering the jerky when the shipment arrived today we expected the same as we have had before only this time it was awful i have read others reviews stating the jerky was hard as a rock and thought they exaggerated for effect i learned today they are not this will be the last time i order this product and i would hope that amazon would take to providing a little better quality control on items like this it is all fun and games til someone loses a tooth ,0
i could not find melba toast in any grocery store around me not even at wal mart i ordered and it was here in short order tastes really fresh and good ,1

i have to give it star because they wont allow for any less this bacon dressing is also waaaaaayyy too sweet the chemical taste of the splenda overtakes the taste of the actual product itself i could never understand why they have to add soo much artificial sweetener to something such as a salad dressing this is one of the five walden is calorie free product i have tried and been very disappointed with i was already taking my chances knowing it was sweetened with splenda instead of stevia but for god is sake why make it soo unpalatable there are soo many alternatives out there and why kill it with soo much sweeterner my other reviews for these products may be around the same but darn i best just make my own dressing might not be calorie free but at least it will be consumable why make ranch sweet in the first place that is nasty ,0
i tried this because i had been reading it would increase breast milk but it did not do anything for me ,0
i thought these were going to be dried fruit turns out it is dried but full of sugar not what i needed taste is ok though ,0
diabetic and health conscious i read every label reject many products i am rarely brand loyal these plain tea biscuits remind me of the little animal shaped crackers of my childhood lunchbox school days i absolutely love them they leave no funny aftertaste and are just the right size love love love them ,1
i have been making black tea in my bodum iced tea pitcher and wanted to try a nice loose green this one works perfectly it has a mild taste that is very fresh ,1
the product came very promptly i had no problem placing the order i e the process was quick and easy i have no complaints however i have ordered this product before from you with complete satisfaction ,1
this is very different than any coffee drink i have had it is more like soda coffee i chilled mine and did like it there is a little soda fizz but not much and the coffee flavor is very good and robust i did not find it overly sweet like the other reviewers i did not love this drink but did like it okay ,1
i love cinnamon in baked goods and often sprinkle it on hot cereal to give it a more homey taste do not know why cinnamon strikes me as a homey taste other than all the baking my grandma did using it when i was growing up this has the best of all components in it cinnamon is an antioxident oatmeal is good for cleaning the blood of cholesterol and the fiber is just good for general health so what is not to love about this cereal i like to eat cereal dry as a snack in place of popcorn or chips and this has just enough sweet to it that i feel like i am splurging when i am being rather restrained on the sugar front plus this is a great change up for the traditional marshmallow squares recipes for treats i add slivered almonds for a little protein and will be trying it with dried apricots diced up and mixed in for a harvest touch spice makes it twice as nice ,1
i like the product coz of its convinience as it comes from agood brand i do not feel guilty using packaged food for my family ,1
sorry i do not like panning a product but there is no where else to go with this stuff the label is too small for me to read the ingredients and i do not seem them listed online other than in reviews one reviewer says it contains calories and grams of sugar print is so small i am reading with a magnifying glass each packet contains of your daily needs of chromium copper and zinc and of your daily requirement of selenium the eboost blend contains of acai fruit and green tea extract i will take their word for it i have no way to assess the health value nor did i feel any energy boost however i can tell you i did not like the taste it was very sweet but maybe not sugary which i also would not like but more of an artificial sweetener taste if you want sweet colored water with a nasty aftertaste this may be the drink for you otherwise try something like,0
these are the best and most flavorful gummy bears you can get for years i have paid the same price for just pound of this candy from a major mail order catalogue this way i get pounds and a few extra flavors i did not even know they made i assure you that you will not be disappointed with these ,1
i have been using this food exclusively for my fur babies for almost years i figured that if i was worth organic food so were they they love the food too they throw up a lot less never have diarrhea and stay cleaner down there if you know what i mean lol their coats are all glossy and soft too i had one kitty who always had really course hair before i switched to this brand after a few months on this brand exclusively her hair was still course by nature but so much softer and glossier it really makes a difference i highly recommend it if you can afford it like i said in the title the only thing that keeps this from being stars is the insanely expensive price ,1
i have an abyssinian male that was not keeping down seemingly every kind of food i tried it ended being that grain is no good has to be nearly all protein great product ,1
the flavor of dynasty spicy kung pao sauce is wonderful this price however is waaaaaaaay too much less than at the local asian market i will pass ,1
for those tea drinkers who happen to love ginger snap cookies or those great old time windmill cookies now a tea can never replace the taste but this evokes the flavor its good for those who just like the flavor of ginger or are on if it tastes good spit it out type of diet enjoy ,1
i gave this as a gift to my brother everyone really enjoyed them my brother is pre schooler shouted yeah cigarettes to add to the debate i do not believe these candies create smokers me and my brother ate these growing up and neither of us smoke even as teenagers we would get candy cigarettes instead of smoking real ones if anything it was an alternative to smoking for us ,1
i used these to prevent my puppy from chewing of my furniture they lasted awhile and she loved them next time i will order the larger ones for more peace and quiet ,1
i have been ordering organic valley white lowfat milk from amazon for over a year now and they have become a staple on our pantry shelf they provide a very convenient way to give my kids a healthy organic beverage in their lunches or on the go i even take them to work with me i really like the taste this milk is slightly creamier than regular milk and my kids love it because to them it is like a milkshake what i really love is the fact that it is organic and hormone free something i am paying more attention to lately and looking for when buying dairy and meat products organic valley is a company that cares about it is farmers animals and it is consumers their products do not contain pesticides non natural fertilizers synthetic growth or breeding hormones antibiotics or gmo is genetically modified organisms they care about their animals and the land that they graze when you purchase their products you can feel good about what you are serving your family and you are supporting farmers who care as well amazon com sells this product at a great price lower than at my local natural food stores and even large chain stores i save even more by ordering this through subscribe and save i save an additional and have the milk delivered to my door every month you can have it delivered every months and if you run out and need more you can have it sent on demand if you are a busy parent this is an incredible convenience and i highly recommend ordering this and other commonly used items through amazon is subscribe and save ,1

best blend and senseo pod yet very rich and strong tastes incredible i am not sure what the other reviewer who gave it star is talking about it is definetely strong and is guaranteed at least true sumatra the pads are perfect size for a single ounce cup of coffee it is not ounces if you like senseo you will love this blend my second favorite is regular medium blend ,1

i enjoy whole bean coffees from all over the world costco is my major source for beans and they usually come in three pound bags kirkland signature is the most common brand but a few other brands appear from time to time a problem with costco is that at any particular time they may have only two or three varieties but if you come back a month or so later they still may have only two or three but they will probably be a different two or three it is something of an adventure and a good way to exp ore the coffees of the world plus if you find some variety that you really really like you may find it available on line as is this one well here is an excellent coffee it is a guatemalan whole bean coffee nice aroma but relatively mild compared to other bagged coffees excellent taste but it is a quite lighter roast than i am used to that is ok i like variety this one has an excellent coffee taste and is smooth and delicious it goes down easily that is for sure smooth and mellow nice lingering aftertaste i would think that any coffee lover would find it excellent but some may expect a deeper darker roast in a whole bean coffee for me this is a really nice coffee gary peterson,1
i really enjoyed going through a box of nature is path crunchy vanilla sunrise it is low in sugar and yet still very sweet while i am not sure i tasted any vanilla in there it was still pretty good it contains good ole flakes small crunchies and mini kix like cornballs interestingly enough it also has for a healthy yet good tasting cereal give nature is path a try today ,1
these bars are very good and tasty with the right texture and with delicious oatmeal with honey touches they came as a surprise for me as i am used to eat the generic energetic bars from the vending machine at work that usually taste like cardboard and corn syrup these are not like that they are sweet but not overwhelmingly so with the taste of honey being very perceptible the bars are not honey golden in color as many supposedly honey products tend to be nowadays but i see that as a good thing because that color usually comes from caramel and burned sugar not honey very good bars in general ,1
healthy and very much loved by my fox terrier and black scottish terrier i typically prefer giving my dogs bully sticks rather than rawhide but biting the little rice bits off of the rawhide really keeps them busy for hours great product ,1
i use to eat just the plain juice pops that you get at walmart then my roommate introduced me to otter pops i am now addicted these things are so very tasty ,1
i have used a different brand of clothes moth traps before with great results unfortunately this time i decided to try the safer clothes moth traps the lure is a pain to get out of the little pouch without getting it all over your hands not a great idea unless you want moths flying at you and even if you manage to get it into the trap without getting it on your hands well our moths are completely ignoring the traps as though there was no lure at all what a waste ,0
my yorkie is pretty picky when it comes to treats but she loves these i have to break them up before giving them to her but they crumble easily she is on natural balance dog food too great brand ,1
i have been using this truffle salt for about a year now and i can not say enough good about it it is in fact fabulous you need only a tiny pinch to add an incredible truffle flavor to what ever you are serving try roasting asparagus with a little olive oil and a light sprinkle of this truffle salt while it seems expensive initially it takes so little to make a big impact it really is not that costly the truffle scent is so intense you can smell it through the jar and if you are a truffle lover that scent is almost better than french perfume ,1
i am reviewing the golden oreo fudge creme peanut butter flavor when i think of oreos i think of a sandwich cookie but the golden oreo fudge creme cookie is more like a girl scout thin mint cookie only in the case of the peanut butter it is peanut butter flavored as opposed to mint the peanut butter is creamy and not very peanutty and the filling is soft as opposed to the girl scout mint cookie both are enrobed in dark chocolate though i prefer the chocolate in the thin mints these are okay but i would not get them again ,1
before i discovered this product when i made pasta for my husband who has a gluten problem i would make a different product for myself now we both eat corn pasta ,1
this matcha is good compared to its price it is fine and strong smelling i like to use this matcha to make smoothies and works great however the tea comes in a resealable bag that does not reseal very well so it is best to transfer the tea into another container to prevent air from seeping into it and one bag last along time this matcha is bitter strong and delicious ,1
oh boy these cookies are too good i cannot put them down this order is a lot of them but the sleeves are wrapped individually so they can live in the garage and come up one at a time so you do not look like a fiend ,1
i was so disappointed with this tea i bought a box during lunchtime looking forward to a nice cup of tea in the afternoon i made the cup and took a sip yuck it tasted fishy to me but could not figure out why tea would taste fishy so i read the ingredients i wish i had read them before the second listed ingredient is an oil blend of tuna oil soy oil and soy lecithin just the thought of tuna oil in my tea is enough to make me gag the actual taste is just as bad ,0
the prior box of pods i got featured a variety of southern italian pods i loved these at first because of the intense flavor i decided the next order would be for pods similar to what i would find in seattle this box fit the bill nicely these pods are delicious and provided a nice change recommended ,1
these spices help liven up any recipe you can use them for baking and add them to beverages my favorite use for them is to add them to apple cider the smell of apple cider and mulling spices warming on the stove always transports me back to my parents house when my mother would make the cider i completely recommend it fyi for those noticing that what they ordered is not what is shown in the picture aspen rebranded years ago this means they changed their packaging and logo the picture shown with the black beige carton and red cup is old the new is red and beige with cinnamon sticks on the front ,1
it is difficult to rate the taste of food because everyone has unique preferences this milk has a bitter taste that i do not like but it tastes fine when added to food i add it to omelletes cocoa to make tomato soup and oatmeal it adds a rich creamy taste to foods with no detectable bitterness i assume this milk is healthy and i called the company and was told that the goats graze in the fields for some time so i guess this brand is more animal freindly than most edited added one star because it tastes much better when added to foods,1
i ordered this thinking i would get a variety of different teas here is what i celestial seasonsings india spice bigelow mint bigelow pomegranate green celestial seasonsings sleepytime celestial seasonsings lemon celestial seasonsings english breakfast celestial seasonsings mandarin celestial seasonsings green teareally green teas i will not order this again in fact i am returning for a refund the teas were not packaged well they were just tossed into a paper bag ,0
these are large raw hide bone size treats my dog loved them and immediately tore them apart be advised they are a bit of a messy treat there were a lot of tiny particles left over almost dust size that i had to vacuum off the carpet hard to tell if they really provide digestive support but she loved them ,1
i purchased monin is violet syrup last winter when i wanted to make classic cocktails and creme de violette liqueur was not yet widely available it made a delicious if slightly too sweet aviation cocktail now that eric seed of haus alpenz has gotten real classic liqueurs back into stores i prefer the more authentic ingredients that does not mean the monin violet has lost favor in my kitchen when i make a violette fizz i often substitute monin for plain simple syrup for extra violet kick this syrup makes wonderful soda and lemonade it really pleased my teetotaler guests if you are shopping for violet flavoring for baking candy making or flavoring ice cream you should search for extract or concentrate this product is not designed for concentrated use if you do get violet extract you can make your own violet syrup part sugar part water heat over a low flame until the sugar is just dissolved and you have simple syrup once the simple has cooled you can add your favorite extract drop by drop until you are satisfied with the flavor ,1
this shampoo and conditioner has a great fresh scent and washes hair well leaving it soft but not greasy feeling it lathers up well and washes out cleanly a very guy friendly scent not feminine this shampoo is most loved by my pre teen son who prior to this had been using a more kid like version of a shampoo he likes this clear men scalp therapy quite a bit better and has claimed the remainder of the bottle as his the only issue i have with it is this brands bottles of shampoo and conditioner do not always ship well after receiving bottles of clear scalp shampoo conditioner our of the bottles had leaked just a tiny bit during transport they are packaged in plastic bags to help in case leaking but when it came to my orders of them were leaking in some way upon arrival ,1
good sweet crunch that beats a candy bar low in calories has vitamin c and no additives i have also added it to bran cereal and yogurt good way to get a serving of fruits in and easy to throw in your bag for on the go i have tried the organic and regular version and no real difference in taste organic costs more of course ,1
bought a bag but after days my older dog sicker than a dog gave the rest away to the spca and bought newman is own dog food now i have one happy waggy dog again ,0
no problems with this transaction in any way all went without a hitch and the product was just as listed ,1
this drink is a tasty alternative to the yahoo junk drink it does not have a ton of nutrition but if you are looking for something to put in the kids lunch box besides juice everyday i think they will appreciate it it does taste just like the yahoo chocolate drink but is made with much more trustworthy ingredients does not need refrigeration but says to serve chilled the end point is try this for a change and it is something different and enjoyable for any age ,1
i am a fan of ginger snaps and cookies i can not have dairy so i give a thumbs up to lazy day for making them dairy free think twice about ordering these through the mail though mine arrived with the chocolate melted everywhere only half of the cookie is covered in chocolate so your fingers will not get messy holding onto the other half i happily ate these melted and messy though i loved them but they did not taste like your typical ginger cookie more like a shortbread cookie either way i recommend them and i will keep an eye out in stores where they are stored at safe temperatures if you like trying different brands like i do i also recommend,1
this is the most nutritious gluten free cereal i have found i buy it in lots of six ecopacks and i am never out of it ,1
i like this i have had more expensive truffle oils before but i am perfectly happy with this just because it is not from france does not mean its not good a good sparkeling wine champange from california is still better than a bad one from champange france the tase is waht i expected mine were packaged in shrink wrapped plastic and padding stuff and arrived ok truffles i understand grow in many places in the world i have not tasted the finest quality cannot find it much less afford it but this tastes similar to the other black truffle oils i have tasted that were more expensive i have no reservations recommending it as long as you understand its not as subtile as white truffle i e its a bit stronger of a taste it all what you like and can afford its great stuff the other reviewer should have asked for a replacement not a refund you should not derogate the product for something that is the fault of the shipping carrier and possibly the packer ,1
when we lived in germany i first tasted asbach ultra the liquer this candy asbach uralt large assorted gift box took me back to germany with the first piece of candy this is not a candy for children due to the liquer in it for yourself or adults this is definately a wonderful gift or treat so try a box experience a wonderful candy creation sincerely rita h ,1
i love the mixture of fruit and veggies for my month old she has been able to eat these on her own since months i can not say enough about plum organics i even like the taste great food on the go purple carrots are really a nice touch too ,1
i could not find this at any grocery store so i had to order it online it is my favorite condiment it is beautiful on everything ,1
i first got this at iherb to try out just package instead of the amazon i used code and received off my order and free shipping i will now order the from amazon this is really great mixed with oatmeal and for making smoothies the taste is a lot better than the more expensive health food store whey proteins i have tried ,1
i used to be the type of person who never ate breakfast but after buying this stuff i never miss a day i wake up at every morning which does not give me a lot of time to eat i generally leave my house at i put half a cup of muesli in a container with a half cup of milk and some honey and buy the time i get to work an hour and a half commute the muesli is a perfect consistency ,1
tasty but kind of pricey i sort of got hooked on these in germany and although i can find other haribo products in stores color rado can be really hard to find elsewhere ,1
good products and fast shipping equals a happy me a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavors a few i cant find anywhere else so def worth the price,1
these are so good i wanted to buy them and try them first before i gave them out as holiday gifts a few years ago i bought a ton of my sister favorite cereal and sorted out all the marshmallows to give to her as a gift now i dont have to sort them i am not a sugar cereal fan but i love these marshmallows yummy ,1

in general i advocate against consuming grains or cereals however love crunch is made with reasonably good ingredients the primary ingredient is rolled oats and blended to an enjoyable chocolate flavor spelt is one of the healthier forms of wheat it is far more desirable nutritionally than modern wheat the sugar to fiber ratio is three to one six grams of sugars to two grams of fiber per serving which is not the best of all cereals but it is reasonable you have got to love all the healthy ingredients chocolate flax seeds coconut and fruit for a processed food this one is not too bad ,1

a local bakery here sells cinnamon chip bread i was able to google a recipe bought these chips to use i learned the hard way that these melt easily if you add them to bread machine dough they will melt making your dough very runny instead i set my machine to dough setting after it has risen i roll it out sprinkle these on top then roll it up for a loaf turned out very yummy without the melting problem very tasty ,1

this brownie mix really does make some of the best brownies i have ever had mix or no mix i could not believe it when i read the reviews but they really are just that damn good for anyone who is a bit put off by the amount of butter called for in the recipe what i have found is just as good to do is to put half butter and half vegetable oil it is still incredibly rich and chocolately and very moist that way of course if you want the ultimate experience then of course you would put all butter in just be sure to share so you do not go into brownie food coma people you have been warned ,1
i love green teas and have tried many different kinds sometimes it is a hassle to make tea at work or on the go which is why i gave ito en sencha shot a try i was very happy with it you can drink it hot or cold when it is hot it is a smooth earthy and strong tea perfect for mornings when cold it is about twice as strong and almost tastes like grass which i think is good in the afternoon you will get a boost of energy and get a full feeling after drinking this it is a wonderful drink and it is really good for you ,1
my husband loves these oatmeal raisin cookies they are his favorite and we both agree that they are healthiest store bought option on the market ,1
here in sw florida i find it difficult to locate spinach pastas i have now ordered this pasta at least several times and i am always more than satisfied with the quality the taste the cost what i especially like is the cooking time this pasta seems to be ready for serving in about two thirds the time other pasta takes ordering in quantities of six allows me to also share a bag or two or three with friends ,1
i never follow the recipe and prepared this how i thought easiest it definetely requires more thought than a regular hamburger helper but tastes really good i was actually expecting something different like others but i was impressed not like my mom is lemon chicken at all they maybe should change the name but not the recipe ,1
it is my own fault that i did not realize i always buy the ounce and this is only ounce cans i have never even seen them in this small of a size i only buy them on sale so the price per can for the ounce is more than i normally buy the ounce for amazon will not allow you to return food even though this is cans and was still in the plastic wrap ,0
this shelter kitty had tried it all but since being fed whiskas purrfectly chicken he will not consider anything else he prepares to eat if i offer somthing else but stops short of the bowl like he is sniffing his food and turns his head and walks away he will not eat any other of this brands products nor any other brand no matter how expensive the pouch is not convenient but the fact that i know he will eat and enjoy his food makes up for it ,1
i used to drink gevalia kaffe it is an excellent brand but one that got increasingly expensive and then it stopped being eligible for amazon subscription i remembered douwe egberts from a european trip and decided to give it a try i have been very happy with it if you want a rich robust coffee that does not taste burnt ala starbucks you might like this ,1
i have tried both the penne and the love short fettuccine and both are great i prefer the texture and taste of the fiber gourmet over regular pasta they say this pasta is also better for you what a bonus ,1
when it comes to flavors in a good cup of espresso coffee it is all in the way how the beans are roasted the robust flavor of this coffee should make the most desiring espresso lovers proud and it has a little secret which most of us italians would not admit in public it is decaffeinated wow a double whammy i have been using this coffee for several years now and no other decaf pre ground coffee comes close ,1
the chocolates were stale and certainly not worth the cost of the product would not purchase again ,0
plocky is chips are made of several whole grains and have a touch of sweetness they are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips the flavor out performs any tortilla chip i have ever eaten they hold up great to salsas and dips nothing wimpy about them i just wish the company made a bigger bag love them usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery but seem to be difficult to obtain as the shelf is always empty order by the case you will be glad you did as they disappear fast ,1
almost too mild for my taste but a great cup to serve to company does create a nice layer of crema on top not throughout the cup ,1
i decided to try raw honey about a year ago and was a bit overwhelmed with all the choices i ended up at my local health food store and found stakich raw honey it is produced about an hour from me so given the speculation that raw honey from flora in your area helps with allergies and liking to support local businesses i decided to give it a try i love it the taste is delicious and sweet i have used it to replace all of our aregular honey uses and no one in my family can tell the difference the texture is definitely more grainy than processed honey but that is to be expected i mix a tablespoon of stakich raw honey and a teaspoon of stakich bee pollen into my greek yogurt each morning and start my day with a nutritious and delicious breakfast try it you will not be disappointed ,1
blue dog bakery premium natural soft treats in peanut butter flavor are excellent all of our dogs love them including all our neighborhood dogs they are great for small dogs as you can cut them in half or fourths making it easy for the little ones i have not found a dog yet that does not like them they come from a good manufacturer you will not have to worry about any recall of blue dog bakery products i highly recommend them try them your dog will thank you ,1
i have looked for these everywhere recently walmart target publix and could not find them in stores i decided to go ahead and order them even though people were giving mixed reviews on the flavors they were getting in our package i received orange blueberry strawberry apple yes apple i was surprised to see it since most said they did not get apple but we did it is unfortunate that they can not stock the packages evenly with of each flavor but it was well worth the price no screw off lid like others had said but that was not a huge selling point for me either prices were much better than on the actual florida is natural website where they were for each carton and they only offered orange blueberry strawberry plus i got free day shipping with amazon prime so my daughter i are already enjoying them ,1
this is the best way to store your t discs i have been using it for about a year and it works great it holds two packages t discs easily and rotates freely good product ,1

do not get me wrong i really wanted to love this as i had read so many great things about coconut water i was so excited when my order came i had some already in the fridge so it was cold after i had a great workout i went to grab my coconut water i was shocked at how disgusting the taste was i tried it again i tried it over ice i tried it through a straw and nothing made it taste palatable if you have not had coconut water before try one first before you buy a case my next step is going to try and mix it with a variety of liquors and see if i can stomach it good luck ,0
rather than the complex creamy sauce you expect on butter chicken this tastes more like campbell is tomato soup with a few spices added flat artificial tasting and not buttery at all totally disappointing ,0
excellent product could not be more pleased easy to use and my african violets do so much better when feed with this product thank you schultz ,1

hesitantly i ordered these in a case cans on our try what a pleasant surprise they are very tasty and the texture is great my husband a carnivore can not tell the difference in his signature buffalo chili they are now on auto ship to our home every few months a great swap out for eating lower carb the texture is as far as i can tell identical to traditional black beans the flavor is a little different not worse than traditional canned black beans but when seasoning is added i could not tell one bit of difference note i did not even think about this before ordering but after receipt inspected the nutrition label and found that these black beans actually have more calories per serving than traditional black beans trader joe is it is not much of a difference i am still on the black soy bean bandwagon but it is something to consider here are the side by side nutrition facts soy compared to traditional canned black beans from trader joe is serving size soy tj is total fat soy tj is saturated fat soy tj is trans fat soy tj is cholesterol soy tj is sodium soy tj is potassium soy not provided tj is total carbohydrates soy tj is dietary fiber soy tj is sugars soy tj is protein soy tj is ,1

the tea leaves are marvelous well formed not torn not cut the tea has a lovely grassy slightly astringent flavor it is medium bodied but full in the mouth i would buy this tea again but i must note it is not very fragrant which is part of the tasting experience it tastes great to me but i do not get much jasmine despite an abundance of petals in the tea for the price i highly recommend it unless you are sorely bent on the jasmine fragrance ,1
this is good coffee fresh came quickly local stores can not seem to get their pricing in order so i will buy it online it is cheaper will buy again ,1
finally i found a product i like vitamin squeeze energy drink i have tried many many different water enhancers like crystal light mio lipton but vitamin squeeze has calories sugar and carbs vitamin c of vitamins zinc mg caffeine taurine and electrolytes i really do not care for artificial sweetners they leave a horrid aftertaste with me and i stay away from them vitamin squeeze is sweetened with sucralose i have reviewed other products with sucralose and have not cared for them at all there is something different in the mix with vitamin squeeze that i prefer over the above mentioned products and i can tell you that i will be trying and buying the different varieties of vitamin squeeze ,1
this tuna is the best tasting canned tuna i have ever purchased in a can wild planet used to label their tuna cans bpa free wild planet paid for it is own testing of the cans and the results came back bpa positive several times so they removed the bpa free label from the tuna cans the last news i could find on their website was that they were continuing to search for a solution to this problem ,1
this is our second shipment both timely deliveries product as described the second product seemed to be fresher than the first our dog is on a restricted diet for skin allergy and this snack was recommended by our canine dermatologist for some reason it is not available locally except through a vet better price in bulk doggie seems happy with it too thanks ,1
let me start off by saying that i am not a tea drinker at all i am more of a coffee person anyway i decided that i was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply i went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose it says on the box that the tea is very bitter so i went ahead and added teaspoon of honey it worked perfectly i do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically i went from pumping times a day to twice a day the two days since i started drinking the tea yesterday i only did it once and today none so far i am not in pain though my breasts are still tender to the touch i would recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply ,1
no complaints with the product i have been buying the brand of oatmeal for a longtime and it has never always been spectacular i definitely recommend it everyone ,1
my family loves this spice mix it is not spicy hot it is a mild flavor with a definite emphasis on sweet first couple ingredients are sugar be careful not to burn your food sugars burn easily i use pre mixed spice rub as well as make my own great on pork chops and hamburgers i am sure it would be great on ribs as well ,1
used it to bake some cookies instead of butter nice result coconut oil is always a little pricey tho and i wonder if over use of tropical oils is bad for the tropical habitats ,1
these were great for my daughter is kite party i put them on the top of the cupcakes and used liquorish whips as strings they actually taste good too melt in your mouth unlike some sugar candies that can be really hard ,1
i discovered that i was gluten intolerant about a year ago and have been looking for good tasting wheat free products ever since my primary roadblock has been bread every single loaf of gluten free bread i have tried has been beyond disgusting i have been to health food store after health food store and have not found a single loaf that i can eat without gagging i thought it was hopeless until i read the reviews of pamela is amazing wheat free bread mix i decided to give it a shot so i borrowed my sister in law is bread machine and fired up a loaf simply put i was amazed at the results does it taste like regular bread no well almost is it light years beyond any other gluten free breads a hearty resounding yes if you have eaten other gluten free gf breads before let me give you a comparison it holds up better than pre made gf bread but it still feels like it could fall apart easily putting a slice in the toaster helps with that it is a little on the chewy side it tastes like it does not have any salt in it so adding some butter really helps it kind of looks like banana bread if i were to compare textures make sure to have some milk on hand because it makes you pretty thirsty when you eat it i would say this is as good as real bread thank goodness my search for wheat free bread is over and amazon sells it for nearly half the price as my local health food stores if you are the only gluten intolerant or celiac in your family i would recommend picking up a bread machine it makes one loaf automatically all i did was to follow the direction on the package and the loaf came out perfectly it was as simple as dumping the ingredients in the machine making sure the settings were right and hitting the on button so easy even a caveman could do it i put the bread machine to work at about at night and woke up the next morning to freshly baked gluten free bread edible bread awesome i used a older zojirushi machine but some of the newer models like from breadman actually have a gluten free setting on them there is hope for decent tasting bread for us gluten intolerant people thank you pamela is products ,1
i can unequivocally say that a bloody mary made using dimitri is bloody mary seasoning either the classic recipe or the classic plus horseradish will be the best bloody mary you will ever taste bar none my husband and i both feel that we have never experienced such great bloody marys in any restaurant or bar in our entire lives and we are in our sixties if you have ever tried to make one yourself and been consistently disappointed because it turned out too hot too bland too spicy or not spicy enough you will know what i mean with dimitri is it makes a consistent tasty bloody mary every time and it does not matter whether you are using plain tomato juice or juice buyers should note this is not a bloody mary mix like mr mrs t is dimitri is is a bloody mary seasoning mix in liquid form that you add to the tomato juice creating an instant tangy completely ready to go bloody mary and once you have tasted it you will never go back to mixing them from scratch and you will toss all your mr mrs t is out the door you will not find dimitri is in most grocery or liquor stores so buying it here is a great find and it is cheaper at amazon than it is on dimitri is own website so if you want a superlative bloody mary that both you and your friends will rave about when you invite them over make it with dimitri is you will become an instant fan for life and do not forget to add a hot dilly bean celery stick or marinated asparagus stalk to the drink it is great ,1
i have been counting my carbs for a few years and one of the hardest things i have had to do is give up bagels until now oh my goodness these are the most amazing everything bagels ever the flavor it excellent and they toast up beautifully i buy packages at a time i put one in the freezer and yes they freeze well i am hooked i am so happy to have my bagel fix again thank you carb krunchers so if you are missing your bagels give these a try you won t be disappointed ,1
i bought this a few days ago and it came in a timely manner in a sealed airtight bag i have had several cups of it so far and it is different from every other cup of orange tea i have ever had it is darker in color when brewed it seems like the tea is average on fruit it seems sparse but somehow a piece has ended up in every cup there is not much emphasis on the orange or spice it does not taste like anything from bigelow or stash it is unlike any store brand i have tried the flavor of the orange and spices is muted while some more of the flavor of the tea itself comes through that could be the difference i note i think the tea is good but it is not what i expected i have divided it into three one quart mason jars with some left over in the original bag the flavor is not bad or off it is just different for the price just under i would buy this again also in the jars i have noticed something quite odd i cannot explain this but on the top edge of the jar where the seal meets the jar oil has been at this location on all the jars when i opened them from storage in a pantry the oil smells like the tea and spices i find this highly unusual update i still really enjoy this tea and would recommend it to others after my initial shock in the difference in flavor i think the flavor is great it tastes more complex hot than warm or cold i would definitely buy this again ,1
i have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive i can not stop eating them it is crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt just perfect believe me some chips are so salty i can not finish a small bag but this one i just keep on eating ,1
this is a delicious black china tea blend presented in a beautiful highly giftable tin box this tea is available in oz and tea bags i usually get the tin as i am the only black tea lover in the house one tin of oz is enough for one large cup a day for months so i am guessing cups i use a mesh infuser as usual with kusmi the tin is beautiful with raised flower details and old fashioned design and colors the blend is a glistening black tea with pieces of citrus peel the nose is reminiscent of a bergamot earl grey with spicier notes that i would describe as all spice nutmeg and even a hint of turmeric the mouth is smooth low tannins with beautiful layered flavors of vanilla and soft spices and a savory sweet finish kusmi recommend a brewing temperature of to to so make sure the water sits for a few moments after boiling before pouring over the tea i usually like a rather long infusion time maybe to minutes i do not add anything to this tea but a sweetener would probably work if you like to my knowledge prince vladimir was one of kusmi is first blend in the late is and remain one of the most popular i would highly recommend it to lovers of complex flavored black teas in particular if you already appreciate some higher end bagged teas mighty leaf vanilla bean or orange dulce i think you should give this superior blend a try cheers ,1
this olive oil is so good it is light and buttery i will never buy another kind of evoe again the price at amazon is good too ,1
right flavor arrived and our whole family loved it including kids we prefer this one so much more than the lemon i had to change my subscription to once month instead of every three months both the chocolate and the tart raspberry flavors are present but it is not sickeningly sweet like most bars it is a great snack to throw in the lunch box or to take along in the car when you feel munchy ,1
 would taste pretty good and not even out in the wilds of katanga i bought a case of juanita is pozole some pork some chicken to stash in my cellar as emergency rations after the earthquake near san francisco and i finally opened a can of it at a campsite on labor day of course you can not just gobble it as it pours from the can it needs the traditional fresh condiments chopped onion oregano dried or fresh chopped green chilis red chili flakes and lime juice and then it is close to delicious the can holds enough for two good portions this price is a few cents higher than what it costs in most ethnic corner groceries and shipping makes it quite a lot higher if there is not an ethnic corner grocery that would carry such a product in your neighborhood i have one piece of advice move ,1
omg what were they thinking when they came out with this product how do we know that this metal tasting water will not cause cancer down the line really sad that the people from the real housewives of nj came out with this stuff instead of getting us sick with this black water just keep it simple and get us sick with melissa is music from the show ,0
doing a low carb no carb type thing morning cream in your coffee adding unwanted carbs to your count well step right up friends if you are eating a low carb diet then you are probably using heavy whipping cream for your coffee creamer that is good stuff but it does add carb per tbs that is what makes splenda with fiber so dang excellent you get net zero carbs per cup of coffee that makes a big difference in your day if you are shooting for very low carb intake so not only do you make your morning joe neutral you also get fiber that you need anyway win win i cannot tell any difference at all between this packet and a regular packet coffee taste exactly the same and i am real picky about the taste it is expensive i bought mine box at the local big box store which is a little less expensive that the current price at amazon but not that much difference free shipping and always available more than makes up for the small price difference love it highly recommended ,1
i have eaten this cereal for years no problems the last batch i purchased however was filled with worms subsequently i will not buy this product again ,0

i am amazed at how much brighter the taste of this salt is compared to common salts there is a difference ,1
this brownie mix came to us in a gift box and we loved them so we bought a case since then we have problems with them are they supposed to be oily and come out bubbly and liquidy i do not remember them doing that the first time it is like they separate baked on the edges and goo in the middle and it does not matter how long they are baked we still eat them but i wonder if there is something wrong or if we are doing something wrong ,0
these flakes are really good for you and they taste great buying them from amazon makes the price affordable also ,1
i love this and is not easy to find stores run out of them so quickly it is sooooooooooooo good it gives such a pleasure when you eat it touch down is the best one loooooooooooooooove it,1
when this arrived there were no whole dog treats in the bag the bag was filled with what looked like coffee grounds except it was moving with dozens of live maggots this was the worst amazon purchase ever do not buy this product ,0
this is interesting stuff first let me say that this is the best hot sauce we have tried and are on our bottle now initially or drops was all we could handle in a dish but now it is really not that hot i am not bragging here now a teaspoon seems to be just the right amount the flavor is what really stands out much more so than most other sauces this stuff really adds flavor the peppers are sweet and tasty and when used in cooking really become an important ingredient adding more flavor than heat do not get me wrong the stuff is hot no doubt it is just yummy hot enjoy ,1
this product can be very useful for anyone who prepares low calorie sweetened drinks in larger than single serving amounts my family and i drink a lot of iced tea bottled teas cost a lot and powdered tea mixes taste pretty awful so i began to brew fresh tea one gallon at a time because we also prefer to avoid empty sugar calories i was tearing open little packets of equal for each pitcher of lemon iced tea that was tedious and i did not like throwing away a zillion little blue paper shreds either my solution i bought this one pound bulk package of equal now i just pour grams of equal into a gallon of tea i use my kitchen scale to get the sweetness just right and add lemon juice bingo i like it better than bottled teas fresher tasting not so sweet and it is much cheaper there are no empty bottles to throw away recycle and i can serve as much tea as i want at the moment one pound of equal sounded like an awful lot for home use until i realized that we were already buying boxes of equal packets from the local big box store there is more than a pound of equal in each of those boxes one pound of bulk equal is enough for gallons of iced tea sweetened to my taste about months worth though obviously your mileage may vary now i am even thinking of buying amazon com is bulk equal in six packs that would get me a better price per pound plus free shipping a drop in price for buying a two year supply of equal hmmm ,1
very fresh and tender had a nice texture and flavor eat within the first week of opening or it gets stale ,1
a great tasting drink and full of things that are good for you but i found that i no longer had an appetite i checked out the ingredient super citrimax on the internet and found that it is an appetite suppressant so i thought perhaps that is why i had lost my appetite i have since cut down drastically drinking fuze and my appetite seems to be returning slowly so if you want to cut down on your eating this might be the drink for you but if you are already a light eater you might want to proceed with caution ,1
i had never tried this product before nor heard of it until i came across a vegan recipe i wanted to make incredibly low sodium soy sauce has an astonishing mg per tbsp bragg is liquid aminos only has mg per tsp one squirt adds a lot of flavor the first time my husband and i tasted it we were impressed it is better than soy sauce has an all natural mild taste loaded with flavor but not too salty would be excellent on vegetables soup or rice liquid aminos also contains essential and non essential amino acids i had a hard time finding this product in a regular grocery store there are no health food stores near so i was delighted amazon carried it i will never go back to soy sauce ,1
grew up on this stuff brings me back like that scene in rattatuie best stuff on the planet ,1
we are big oatmeal eaters mccann is has always been our favorite brand since they are unavailable most of the time in our locale ordering them on amazon was a no brainer chewy creamy yummy and good for you too ,1

lipton raspberry instant mix is so easy to make just put a few spoons of the product in a glass of water and add ice it has such a light fruity taste that you feel good every time you take a drink try it when you come in the house after a hot time in the garden sooo good,1
erewhon is one of my two favorite raisin brans i had always liked raisin bran but when i tried skinners raisin bran it was so much better that i switched exclusively to them later when skinners became impossible to find in stores i would try new brands hoping to find a brand that tasted like skinners erewhon tastes as good as skinners taste and texture does not get soggy as quickly as other brands and i am delighted to find a source for my favorite cereal again ,1
so it came with beautiful greens and full of flowers was really optimistic no instructions i e how old is it after the flowers died it got fleas which are soil related it bugged my other plants however its a cutting of a shrub not a bonsai its just stuck in a bonsai pot now i am in the bug spraying mode frustrating it would have been easier to care for it as a plant since its buggy now i have to train it into a bonsai it seems root bound but we are not supposed to anything the first year gardenias are hardy but delicate so i am frustrated with spraying for bugs and for the season i have to bring it in and i hate bugs ,0

unless you are used to eating this kind of food and enjoy it do not buy i read the reviews that the vegetable protein tasted like meat and would absorb whatever it was cooked in i cooked it in a meat sauce just to make sure it resembled meat and it did not at all ended up throwing it away and using ground beef ,0
dubliner is my all time favorite cheese cheddar used to be my favorite but dubliner beats it hands down in fact if i were forced to choose only one food to eat for the rest of my life i would probably choose this cheese try it you will love it ,1

a look at the seasoning ingredients and i thought i would love this mix organic jalapeno organic cilantro organic lime juice organic spices it is full of things i love however when i received the mix and tasted it i was overwhelmed i thought maybe it was just too concentrated so i also purchased a bag of the go raw naked seed mix and mixed them half and half there is just something off about the flavor it does not taste right i have only eaten them by themselves however so they might be okay if sprinkled on a salad but definitely not something i could just snack on by themselves i will not purchase them again ,0
we love mango in my house we have tried other brands this is by far the best sweat they go so fast we can not keep them around ,1
this is my daughter is favorite variety from all of the earth is best veggies they are all good but she likes these the best and honestly i am so surprised by the review above that says they are bad that i am wondering if the reviewer got a bad batch these are organic sweet potatoes prepared for a baby so of course they are not oversalted or topped with marshmallows or otherwise destroyed but they do taste just like an oven baked sweet potatoe without any toppings ,1
have to admit i have never had jack links x stick or any other jack links product and have no idea what they taste like i bought these because i know a marine in afghanistan loves them and so do his buddies this particular item is perfect for military care packages each unit is individually wrapped so nothing goes stale or gets sand in it after the box is opened the small size box is great for people without a lot of storage or personal space the single servings are ideal for sharing without wiping yourself out of goodies and fit into cammy pockets without taking up a lot of room or adding to the weight you are carrying they make a welcome change from mre is or when you need a quick energy boost the convoy can not always stop for lunch even if you do not know if your fighter likes them i guarantee they will be appreciated remember when the kids traded lunches in school they may be older but trading goodies within the unit is a time honored tradition too ,1
oh henry candy bars have always been my favorite and at age i still enjoy them as much today as i have in my youth for the longest time i was not able to find oh henry candy bars anyplace in our area i finally dicovered them on the interent and wasted no time in ordering a box of a real surprise and a treat i shared with friends who were delighted and surprised that they were still being made i would hope that they will once again be available in our local stores ,1
marathon running playing basketball staking out a drug lord before the big take down horseback riding in the grand canyon fleeing from the infected what do all these have in common the need for hydration sure you can drink from that standing pool of mosquito infested water and die of a horrible disease or obey your consumerism weakness to advertising and drink a bottle a colored high fructose corn syrup or you could just throw all caution into the wind and drink a can of soda or you could drink something that is good for you good clean water augmented with science essentia ph drinking water is water and electrolytes and absolutely no sweeteners artificial or otherwise what is that you want sugar well i will be one step ahead of the zombie hoard while you die from a carbohydrate crash and i am still running strong by drinking water the way it was meant to be essentia is enhanced with minerals like water from a pure cool mountain stream essentia is formula is designed to replenish exactly what your body needs after physical exertion without anything you do not need plus it tastes great could save your life and tastes refreshing why would you settle for less ,1
i was concerned that i might not be able to get these chocolates in time for christmas but they did a great job of shipping them out quickly ,1
i can not go a day without having at least one cup of this tea it is so fragrant and delicious just the right balance of green tea and jasmine very smooth i disagree about the caffeine kick noted by another commenter maybe i am immune to the caffeine but i do not feel it i drink a cup in the evening and go to sleep just fine ,1
when i received my last order both cases were full of bent cans while i would never have purchased a bent can atpet food or grocery store i decided not to return the order as it is so much trouble since i had a good stock of food for my cats i put the cases in cabinet unopened my six cats all eat rx science diet as their basic diet i use two cans of this daily split amoung them for treat two days after arrival of product i note a disgusting smellcoming from kitchen area two cans were so badly damaged they were open i threw the rest away i have a total of eight rescued animals all cats are alley cats and the dogs are mutts they are gold to me the cats are well cared for indoor pets obviously i clean constantly and support the clorine and disinfectant industry this was a disgusting experience for me i am canceling my monthly order now ,0
shipped and arrived in excellent condition was the hit of my white elephant family event not sure how it tasted but it seemed like it was fresh ,1
i have had to change my diet drastically and i was missing dark chocolate so much until i found these chocolate chips i thought i would have to give up all store bought dark chocolate these do not have anything bad unless you think these ingredients are bad evaporated cane juice chocolate liquor non dairy cocoa butter that is it that is all these have in them these are worth every penny and so delicious i get them at clark is market a bit expensive but like i said they are worth it so that i can eat chocolate again ,1
this is not only our favorite coffee but the price you can get it for cannot be beat not only that but you can arrange to have it automatically deliveres every months or whatever time frame you want or just buy it once and savor every sip ,1
i had my month old on nystatin for days with no days of these drops and thrush had vanished completely,1
both of my daughters and several of their friends have noticed that when they chew this gum it gives them terrible sore throats there is evidently something in this gum that is not good ,0
of the torino classical grissini thin bread sticks were broken into pieces otherwise the flavor is just a little better than the other grissini brands all the brands of the thicker bread sticks have a more natural and fresher flavor the thicker ones do not taste as artificial as the grissini i would have given this stars if most of the sticks were not broken ,0
not sure what happened to the other reviewer is product but mine arrived in two days same formula i can buy at the store percent off and no need to clip coupons ,1
sturdy construction holds a lot of k cups easy to access does not take up that much more counter space received as advertised ,1
we use ketchup packets in our lunches it takes several months to use up a box according to heinz the shelf life of ketchup packets is months the product i received is months old i will have to donate it to a food bank this is a good product but not fresh enough for extended use i will purchase at gfs after this i am very disappointed ,0
okay i got the variety pack because i wanted to try out all the different flavors and i am glad i did personally i love the chocolate chip cookies they are super and the cinnamon ones are really good too the oatmeal cookies taste a bit like cake batter to me and the sugar ones just were not for me this is not something i would keep on hand to snack on but it is a fun treat the cookies are small like famous amos size and they are also hard cookies so if you only like soft bake these will not be for you a lot of gluten free products have a funky after taste and i only really tasted that in the sugar and oatmeal flavors ,1
guiltless gourmet blue corn tortilla chips are very tasty and healthier for you than other bag chips since they are baked not fried my other favorites from guiltless are mucho nacho chili lime and yellow corn ,1
not only does my dog love it it is very healthy for him he actually waits to eat his dry dog food until i put a spoonful of pumpkin on top definitely will order this product again ,1
to be honest the thing that made me want to try this was the bottle it has de cecco stamped in the glass on both sides simple but very effective those italians they never cease to amaze me when it comes to the oil perfect for cooking except for when i do asian cooking i always use olive oil this one is perfect for the job it has a nice balanced taste giving the food the needed twist without overpowering everything else and when in need you can of course also use it for salads it is that good highly recommended ,1
i bought this after all the glowing reviews and to be honest i do not get it it has a slightly bitter taste and really has a columbian coffee component to it overall i am really disappointed i previously bought coffee from another seller here and while neither of these was no where close to the best sumatra i have had the first one was definitely smoother i will give this another couple tries but if i can not get it straightened out i will not be buying this anymore and i will be asking for a refund ,0
i bought these almonds because i love almonds when i received them it came nicely packaged and i could not wait to try some when i sliced open the bag it had such a wonderful smell to it almost like a cotton candy smell when i ate one oh my it was wonderful i will order this product again and would send them to my daughter some time in the future for a gift as she loved the taste of them also to anyone wanting a great almond candy try these you will love them,1
these are so yummy dark chocolate covered in fruit bits the pomegranate ones are really good as well a bag lasts quite a long time definitely share your friends will be happy ,1
after having searched every store in charlotte nc and not finding crosse and blackwell mincemeat i finally ordered from amazon and had one jar for christmas and an extra for next thanksgiving it was horribly expensive though ,1
the light foam layer on the gummi frogs makes an interesting mild flavor mixed with the fruitiness of the gummi portion these are a nice textural change from gummi bears and a few of them satisfies the sweet tooth ,1
there are way too many flavors going on in this breakfast cookie at least for my tastebuds whomever was in charge of adding spices really went too far to the point that it is actually nauseating obviously i will not be ordering this one again ,0
i love these chips it is great to have some choice and variety in snack foods i do think this flavoring is too salty though i want to try all the flavors soon ,1
this product is not mild also it is bitter to the taste if you are looking for something mild this is not it it is a waste of money if you want something with great taste and a milder form try tobasco is brand of green pepper sauce in green bottle it does not have the bitterness of this product and it is readily available in supermarkets the shipping cost on this product is tantamount to highway robbery ,0
the miracle berry tablets work just as described they make anything that tastes sour taste sweet instead lemons and limes taste like they are coated in sugar etc the problem i had was that the effects of the tablets were short lived and somewhat disappointing after about ten minutes the effect from a whole tablet fades to hours is probably the effect you get from the real fruit but these tablets are weak other than that a real amazing treat ,1
i bought this product at yoke is in sandpoint idaho and it is fabulous hot hot black pepper flavor with a savory burn that feels good on a crisp winter morning a real plus for me is that it has no msg but the real reason why i can eat this is that it has no soy protein of any kind soy is an extreme allergen in certain people like me and frankly has no business being in food i salute old trapper for making a delicious soy free msg free peppered beef jerky my favorite flavor at a reasonable price made in usa ,1
these pig ears are almost as large as the ones i get from a feed seed store which are a piece they are stored in plastic bags and not just thrown in box this is a great buy ,1
i really wanted to like these and on first inspection they seemed like a wonderful fluffy wheat bagel i toasted and slathered on a cream cheese salmon spread the first bite was ok a little different the second bite i better chew and swallow fast the the third bite threw up in my mouth a little bit had to spit it out they really seem lovely and if i was not such a bread connoisseur maybe i would not have known the difference it was kind of like chewing up a cardboard box you can chew for awhile until it gets nasty and then almost have to plug your nose to swallow if you can i am so sorry to give these a poor review because they really went to lengths to make a great product ,0
before i purchased this product i have heard that fox is glacier fruits are amazing in that they contain only real fruit juices frankly i thought that this was just an ad designed to entice buyers but when i ordered it and had a piece of fruit glacier myself i can certainly understand why so many people are looking for it and raving about it unlike other fruit candies whose fruit juice is only about and the rest are just fructose corn syrup fox is glacier fruits use fruit juice concentrates as you put one in your mouth you can certainly taste the wonderful flavors of lemon strawberry etc compared to the other candies flavored with unnatural flavor that mimics the taste of fruits try one and see for yourself ,1
if you are looking at this cereal most likely you already know it is good love the cinnamon and the vanilla the thing i love most about it is that i can order it from amazon and have it delivered to my door cheaper than i can drive to the grocery store and purchase it i live in the country so i can not just pop over to the corner store and pick this up it comes in shrink wrap with boxes no crumbs but if there were i do not mind i like the crumbs ,1
i tried this brand after having a successful experience with the simple brand and they did not measure up the baked chips are bland and they are coated in a film that changes their texture they are to thick and just do not satisfy chip craving as the calorie in take is identical to that of the simple brand i will stick with the latter which is amazing ,0
thanks to those who reviewed this tea and who referred to this brand in other reviews have enjoyed yogi celestial seasonings sleepy teas in the past celestial well bought for price decided not to buy again for lack of taste no individual wrappings to keep tea fresh favored yogi especially when amazon has on sale but even at regular price beats grocery store now that i have tried good earth i think i am pretty much sold on it just as good if not better than yogi husband the coffee drinker in the family even likes it i was a bit leary about buying boxes without trying it first but i was not disappointed will buy again i suggest definately worth a try if you enjoy tea before bed to help relax for sleep does it really help me sleep well it can not hurt right ,1
mate de coca coca tea has been used for centuries in the andean countries as a pick me up and to counter the effects of altitude sickness i did not know it was legal to sell in the u s but was very happy to find it on amazon i ordered some and just made a small pot of tea using two tea bags as a pick me up because i was feeling sleepy and tired the tea is mild tasting much more so than the bitter but caffeine laden yerba mate of the rio de la plata basin and relatively light colored it does pack a kick though and after a couple of mugs of tea i am definitely wide awake do not take this before bedtime it is definitely something to wake you up not put you to sleep the tea is not habit forming andean indians have used it or chewed coca leaves for energy and to stave off hunger from time immemorial you might find that as well as waking you up it suppresses your appetite somewhat so this could be useful for dieters a welcome addition to amazon is offerings and a way to help andean indians who grow coca legally to find a legal market for their product ,1
the lavazza brand of coffee does not taste anything close to this i lived in italy and bought this same product several times and the product from italy tasted a million times better the only thing that is close to the product is the package it smells horrible the color of the beans is too light and dull and it tastes so bitter and disgusting i would actually give the product zero stars if it would let me i will still continue to shop with amazon but do not recommend this product to anyone ,0
i really like all the kind bar flavors but the cranberry almond are my favorite they have the right combination of chew and crunch and like all the kind bars they are completely natural and very flavorful i will not eat any other bar with my coffee great snack and healthy too ,1
i was so happy when i was able to buy this drink on amazon no store or club around me carries it and i do not like the idea of paying over for one at the school kids love them ,1
this is an excellent quality store bought catnip my cat who is quite fussy about his catnip immediately went for the sojo it is not as potent as freshly dried homegrown but it is one of the better catnips out there and it is organic this catnip is not as stalky as some store bought catnip can be nor is it colored to make it appear darker in color may only complaint is that i wish i could buy this in a larger tin ,1
it the order came in ver fast you may be able to find it cheaper else where but it was a great buy be care full orderin in the summer months,1
awesome lollipops they are an old fashion kind of candy and the flavors are all good i like that there are more cherry then the other flavors i think most people prefer cherry so i can understand why they would put more of that in each box the cotton candy flavor are really awesome as well a few usually come broken but that is also understandable as it is being shipped i just open the broken ones and put them into a bowl just as yummy even if or come broken it is better then buying lollipops form the store that are not as good and i never see the charms brand sold in any of the stores i have checked ten bucks for lollipops you can beat it totally worth it ,1
these seseme candies are fantastic even better than chocolate truffles glad to get these at a good price and fast reliable shipping thanks ,1
as a rule i do not eat sweet things but this past easter i asked my significant other to try to get some cream filled chocolate covered easter eggs and some jelly heans the kind that are sweet and taste like they have suger not the jelly beans that have a spicy flavor well she come home with these pastel jelly beans i had never seen before i ate a chocolate cream filled easter egg and then opened the bag of jolly rancher fruit smoothie jelly beans well it is been awhile since easter and i am addicted to these very specially flavored jelly beans i have to say stop when i get started eating them now remember that i said i do not often eat sweets i am not especially fond of them but these jolly rancher fruit smoothie jelly beans are delicious the only problem after easter was passed she could not find but one more bag of them in the whole area where we live well i had the bright idea to check online at amazon com if you need something i always think of checking here first sure enough amazon com had jolly rancher fruit smoothie jelly beans now i just have to wait until morning and have my s o buy me a package of or for my upcoming birthday that would be so nice you see i am down to less than of a bag i have been rationing them now that i have a source i feel reassured that my supply could become endless now i still am not going to gorge myself on them i just will enjoy them as a treat without the worry that there will always be more available and i do not have to wait until easter ,1
we have had trouble with every one of these k cups many of them have not had any air pressure in them and they make a mess all over have had this coffee before and like the flavor but that does not do me any good if the coffee is all over my counter and not in my cup ,0
so i agree with the first reviewer in the consistency of this product its not chunks of meat or veggies but rather a potted meat type goo but i am able to cut it up in little chunks and my dogs love it which surprised me as they turn their noses up to so much i have dogs like iams as an example my dogs hate the stuff but others swear by it the light formula is great as it helps maintain and even reduce weight which is very important if you have small dogs of which i have the other is a boxer and he loves this stuff too i mix it with dry well not mix really but rather put both wet and dry in the same bowl for each dog so i am able to measure how much they each get when i took them off this and opted instead for a more affordable regular wet food the weight came back which is not good especially for my little chihuahua every review should be taken with a grain of salt is this the dog food for you maybe just buy a couple cans and try it how else will you know ,1
 white rose velvet garden white tea is an exciting and unusual premium numi tea it is a white tea more rare than other types of teas and less processed as well having been only plucked and dried not oxidized some people find white tea a subtler and more enjoyable type of tea experience i know i do white rose velvet garden white tea is certified organic and is both fair trade and kosher it is made from hand wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds rosebuds can you imagine those are the only two ingredients and they are delicate and delicious different from anything else i have ever tried this tea like all numi teas is packaged with post consumer waste and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors and i love this and can tell the difference for this and many other reasons numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers on the box numi writes roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance numi is enchanting velvet garden tm releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink with every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate spring white tea imparts a silken smoothness white tea is the tender bud of the tea plant making it exquisitely subtle and supremely healthy high in antioxidants and vitamin c this uplifting fair trade certified white tea blend will be the beginning of a long lasting love affair i have to agree this is truly an amazing tea if you like numi teas get it you will not be sorry if you are new to numi but love white tea or are curious to try it from the description i do not think you could find a better source than numi if you are looking for a romantic tea white rose velvet garden white tea fits the bill perfectly highly recommended ,1
amazing i am a baker and am always looking for easy ways to please the family with something sweet we love the big honking cinnamon buns with tons of goo in the mall which can get a little messy when you are dressed up these buns from the mix are like having all the sweet goodness but from the comfort of home in your jammies so easy and so very delicious ,1
this stuff is awesome but at for a relatively small jar it is very expensive also keep in mind that this powder is very fluffy and will lose a lot of volume when reconstituted if you take out the entire jar and mix water until it is the consistency of peanut butter you will wind up with about or less the original volume so jars at is about the same volume peanut butter as one jar full ouch that being said looking past the outrageous price the product is great my two jars ended up being gobbled down in a matter of days ,1
i was skeptical as i purchased because of the low cost but when it arrived and i opened it i was impressed it is very fragrant and has a lovely flavor ,1
if you have a chance to visit the tao of tea shop at se belmont street in portland oregon you will find a unique place with a unique approach to tea fine tea there is not chopped beyond recognition think of a salad bar of various teas all nicely dried of course displaying a range of colors and shapes that cry out to be sampled tea is of course a matter of taste i especially like the kukicha which includes tea leaf stems that provide a richer darker taste that i crave getting it from amazon com is much easier for me since i live in southern california and cheaper than at the local store that carries it ,1
a good finishing salt with a heavy sea flavor with a bite taste is deep and rich with a slightly mineraly under tone i would not suggest using this on or in a fish or seafood dish though ,1
it reminds me of the orange cinnamon tea that pike place has but this is less expensive and a little less strong since its roobios and not black tea i like this tea more in the winter so i will be stocking up i also like the fact that it has no caffeine since i have been trying to cut down i found this once in a store and could not find it again so i was glad amazon had it i like the pack i will be sharing and i like the free shipping ,1
i have been using this product for years now i use it in all kinds of foods and it really is out of this world good but you really need to be mindful of the amount of salt in it as i have used it in sauces and it was way too salty in the much smaller containers they have reduced salt versions which is what i use in my sauces now i just wish the reduced salt variety came in a ounce container i seem to go through a lot of this seasoning because i use it very often wonderful product though it is kind of my secret ingredient could not cook without it ,1
my husband loves the maxwell house coffee in the filter packs because there is no measuring and he can just put one in the coffee pot and he is got coffee he had come across these filter packs while living out of town so when he came back home he wanted the maxwell house filter packs with several grocery stores in our area we could never find this item i thought i would check with amazon what the heck well there it was and it was cheaper than we would ever seen it before got him boxes and no shipping he is happy as can be because i found a place to get his favorite coffee will be ordering again for sure ,1
good taste and flavour almost as a normal pasta tends to be a little dry so must be fast mixed with the sauce ,1
this is one of the best teas i have had i have tried a variety of oolong teas and this is by far the best flavored oolong tea i have had it is rich without being strong and smooth add a bit of skim milk or soy milk to give it just a touch of sweetness the prince of peace organic white tea is also a superior tea these are sold at reasonable prices ,1
when the plant arrived the packaging was not labled in any way do not crush or keep standing upright if this was done perhaps the little guy would of had some limbs upon opening it badly damaged ,0
my husband and i always a cup of big easy bold every morning its quality has been consistent over the past several years we have ordered if you like a dark roast without the bitterness sometimes found in dark roasts this is the coffee for you ,1
my puppy loves these things although i did not realize they were lungs the one thing is that i wish that they would have lasted longer ,1
i was not sure exactly what to expect but these are very tasty would be a great addition to a pasta dinner stashed upright in a heavy mug as someone else here says though this is a lot of them boxes with apx sticks in each of individually wrapped pkgs they are very long and thin i got them for the hcg diet and i am glad but at a day for weeks i will have about extra boxes i am not disappointed though we will probably find a use for them over the next year ,1
i am a native born saint lucian baron is is the hot sauce served on our island saint lucians as well as vacationers love it i gave some as gifts last year and everyone wants more even my friends who usually do not like hot sauce fell in love with this fantastic sauce if you love hot sauce you are in for a treat baron is saint luican hot sauce is full of flavor and quite spicy and a little goes a long way great to cook with or sprinkle on your favorite dish try it you will not be sorry ,1
i purchased this product it tastes great i use it as a herbal supplement i will definitely buy it again ,1
i love these yes i will purchase these again i have bought pinenuts from whole foods grocery with less quality than these i am very pleased i freeze the ones that i am not using because i think that all nuts like oil could go rancid i love these on salad in pesto and just mixed with raisins great quality and great price ,1
very good choice for backpacking trips i mix it with powdered milk so that just adding water gives a convenient somewhat healthful drink providing some energy the taste is good so that the kids like it ,1
this was recommended to me by a relative it is working just what i needed and it arrived on time ,1
i got tired of paying for a strip of little packs of instant yeast this is how even a casual baker should buy their yeast shipping is high so buy more than one the yeast comes in a heavy duty vacuum pack so the unopened yeast will have a very long shelf life i have used it twice for pizza dough and chiabatta bread and it works great ,1
we have only been using this fencer for two weeks now but are very happy with it was fairly easly to install and is working great ,1
yummy my boyfriend is a diabetic and since he was diagnosed years ago i have been searching for frosting to make a cake and this was perfect he loved it and low and behold i did also our son did to he is and could not tell the difference he had no clue it was not real cake icing ,1
stars on flavor i was concerned about the design of this kcup but its sturdy the only thing that would make this coffee better would be if the packaging was resealable its annoying that i have to put them in their own zip lock once the plastic bag is cut ,1
i have been buying amy is vege chili is for many years there prices were getting a bit high so i did a little online searching and came across chili mans products they are less then half of the cost of amy is i was a bit concerned when ordering by the low cost wow to my surprise it is great vege chili i use it to make nachos most of the time it taste more like home made chili them any other can brand ive tried the consistency is like chili you would get on a famous chili dog i will be a repeat buyer for years to come ,1
i purchased these beans based on other reviews my plan was to make a premium vanilla extract for family members i purchased a very expensive vodka unusual bottles to fill and waited for my bean order to arrive i was not happy about the wait the beans arrived after the and i rushed to open the package i could not smell the beans as others reported most of the beans were skinny shriveled more dry and a great disappointment i would not recommend this product i will be looking for another source ,0
i love these but you can get bags at wall mart for dollars,1
after making an effort to find seed wheat and failing i turned to the internet and got a bag of wheat this spring i planted some in the garden and it is currently knee high with some lovely heads on it i am looking forward to fall when i can harvest and try the second generation from this bag out i have already ground some of what did not get planted into flour and made some delicious whole grain strawberry shortcake ,1
i used to use splenda and of course before that the blue and the pink stuff agave syrup is perfect for my brewed gallons of iced green peach tea or a drop or two over cottage cheese and fruit with toasted almonds the price for this is the best on amazon rather than the local health food stores same brand great quality and free shipping on packs of over,1
the only other flavored coffee i have used was nestle hazelnut it too was a whole bean i really enjoyed that one and thought i pick this one up where the nestle is shared flavor with the bean this one overpowers this one has a burnt note that seems flavoring instead of roast related i like hazelnuts and this a is not anything like hazelnutnow i have of the stuff my mistake more info i am about of the way through the bag my opinion has not changed also i would note a very inconsistent flavor today is grind seems almost devoid of the flavoring it appears they really do not have the adding of flavoring down the intensity of the flavoring is all over the park ,0
nutrition facts posted by amazon list product as organic but it is not usda organic certified and nowhere on the box is the word organic listed ,0
i love the pumpkin spice k cups they have a great flavor and would definetly recommend buying these great way to start off your morning ,1
my cat loves this food keeps her on a good weight and seems to really enjoy eating it the pebbles are also a nice size for digestion she enjoys it so much that she does not want to eat canned food ,1
this sauce is so good i am not that goo with cooking so i am glad i bought this sauce it is exotic with cocounuts ,1
this maxwell house coffee blend is great for morning coffee it goes very well with sitting together with your wife in the outside swing watching the sun rise and enjoying nature at its best the tassimo coffee discs are so easy to use that make great convenient coffee amazon and its subscription order service makes a great partner with my family as far as getting the product and not having to worry about how much is left and whether i can find it in walmart of not with the subscription the order is automatically placed in the time period of my choice and shipped to my home they even save me money off their already good prices as i said great coffee and great service by amazon,1
the container itself is very strong but our lb springer spaniel chewed the rope apart in less than minutes so she could get all of the treats ,0
i found this coffee to be fairly good but by no means outstanding i did not detect any caramel finish in my opinion it cost far more than its worth ,1
this is my only choice for any present or future dog that i will have i have a pomeranian which is a rescue i got him when he was he was raised on diamond which is not the best of pet quality at the time one of the best foods was nutro max even then i never seen a dog puke diarrhea too so much on his food i used to think it was the fact he scarfed it down too fast but if i knew then what i knew now about them i had gotten a rescue chihuahua and he was the cutest little guy of course he was a rescue too over the course of two years he developed some major skin issues it was too the point where he was self mutilating and all he wanted to do is hide in his crate we had switched foods over to natural balance thinking that was the best option while we went from vet to vet to vet with no results to his issues immune blocking medications did not work steroid shots helped temporarily while on n b my pomeranian got huge from all of the potato content he had portion control but could hardly walk because of his loose kneecaps were aggravated by that high carb food with dogs even with an allergy food you have to feed them the exact same things or they will try to each other is food dogs are just as bad as toddlers it was the recall of that opened my eyes to proper pet nutrition my chihuahua was put down that summer as well was it due to the poor food brands over the years was it genetic i will never know the vets could not figure anything out toward the end of that time i found out n b was of course part of the list for food recall they had formulated the ingredients without telling the customers they were using a rice protein that of course was imported from china at first that was denied by the company but they finally fessed up about it i was totally appalled by this brand that i trusted and used for about years now comes the point of evo i did my research and found this to be a great high protein no filler dog food the only reason why i did not know about it before was the fact distribution around here with the brand there is not many places this is really carried at even though now that has improved greatly even though my chihuahua got this towards the last season of his life his skin never improved but he was a tad feistier my pomeranian that could barley walk yelped when he did now runs around and jumps with ease onto the high couch his bmi is back to normal and his energy for a is still amazingly puppy like he wrestles with our persian and places with his toys the kibble is small and round which is easy for smallest of dogs to chew my pomeranian treats the food like it is a steak so i will not ever plan on changing his brand ever again when he is gone i plan on using this for other future dogs i highly recommend this and the cat version for the cat owners of course ,1
i bought several of these fertilizer pesticide stakes and was mildly disappointed in the product our garden has been over run by white flies lately and after reading these could kill them i bought packages and followed the directions in placing the stakes in my pots the product comes with a bunch of stakes and an applicator to place the stakes in your soil simple enough so i added stakes to each pot after a few days the plants looked greener from the fertilizer but the white flies were still out of hand after a week the flies were still there in great numbers so i applied another stakes to each pot fast forward weeks and the flies were still out of control as a fertilizer they work well but in my experience the have no effect on white flies which is unfortunate because it says right on the labelling that it kills them for the price i think you are better off looking at other options ,0

forgive me for being overly dramatic but i consider my quest for palatable convenient lunch options as seriously as some people treat their personal finances or stock portfolios with my daily hour commute i have leisurely breakfasts and dinners only on weekends lunch is the only meal i may actually be sitting down to eat so i expletive deleted refuse to settle for something tasteless i do not have a sweet tooth and that eliminates half the things i can grab from a vending machine carbs put me in food coma and so that eliminates the other half i do not have the discretionary income to eat fig and duck confit sandwiches from the fancy cafe next door to work and that leaves me with having to quest for lunch options i can store in my office cupboard and prepare with the least hassle some of my finds have been decent some have made me cry at how desperate i had become to be eating something that tastes like the aftermath of drunk moose but this this was tasty genuinely tasty ever since i got it out of i wonder what this tastes like curiosity at target ages ago it was love at first bite this product smells strongly and cubicle dwellers may wish to note that but the kit is easy to store the can is easy to open and if you have a napkin you are all set the tuna tastes amazing even if you are not fond of the fish in its other tuna kit or chicken of the sea avatars the slightly spicy slightly sweet zesty flavor of this will appeal to those of you who like more flavor in your food it is thick chunky and not watery so it is not messy to eat and did i mention it is actually tasty this may be the only thing of the many things stored in my office cupboard for food emergencies that i actually enjoy eating though sadly most of my thai chili lunch kits get borrowed by colleagues with such astonishing regularity that i am forced to have this on autoship monthly ,1

i have read in other reviews that the variety was not great i did not have that problem i did not receive equal amounts of each cereal but it was very close i received cocoa krispies and frosted flakes that is the smallest and the largest number of one variety the rest were fairly evenly distributed the packaging is convenient there are only two of us in the house and we do not eat cereal regularly so boxes of cereal end up going stale and being thrown out with the single serve cups we can have cereal when we want and not worry about wasting half of a box i recommend this product to anyone who likes the types of cereal in the variety that is looking for something quick and convenient ,1

wonderful aged balsamic purchased a bottle a couple of years ago and used it very sparingly as you can since it is a rich deep flavorful drizzle great on fresh sliced tomatos and drizzled on cheese worth the price ,1
i purchased this for myself and the contained coffees were quite good the extras were a bit mediocre half due to weak packaging the sugar packets were included in a mislabeled box as were the creamers for your average coffee drinker the extras will be a pleasant surprise just make sure you break open the basket and check the contents if you are giving this as a gift ,1
we have a golden doodle month old puppy she is very submissive and shy about taking most treats we got the liver these treats are great the price was considerably less then most training treats they are small and easy for her to eat quickly they have a great smell to dogs they are low calorie our trainer recommended dry treats because soft treats get stuck in their teeth and can encourage decay these are about the size of a dime perfect size for any dog keep in mind when training you do not need huge treats a treat is a treat to your dog i will definitely be buying more of these i would recommend them to anyone using treats for training ,1

i buy the native forest peaches pineapples and these pears the pears are probably my least favorite of the three i rated the other two stars here on amazon but they are still pretty good not as flavor packed as the peaches and pineapples but still enjoyable bpa issue i emailed edward and son is company that makes native forest brand to find out about the bpa issue after reading a bunch of negative reviews about these cans being bpa lined the answer is that some native forest cans are cans specified to be bpa free according to the edward and son is rep the peaches pineapples and pears i bought were on the list i received in the email so i continued to buy them with confidence the asparagus and baby corn i bought were not on the list so i stopped purchasing them as i did with the peaches and pineapples reviews i will include the list of native forest brand bpa free cans i was given in the comments below but overall these are my least favorite of the native forest canned fruits i buy still pretty good though ,1
i found this to be bland and lacking of flavor if you like weak mild coffee this one might be for you just did not do it for me ,0
our cats have been eating natural balance for a long time they like it and it is endorsed by our vet i started buying it at amazon recently to save a few cents a can and to have it delivered to my house since the cases of this can get heavy i buy cases at a time in both orders i have made i have had to throw away two or three cans because they are so badly damaged that i believe the seal is broken so i am not sure if i am actually saving any money in the last shipment one of my cases was can short and also had a damaged can or two in it so i only got about instead of the first time i ordered i thought this was a fluke but it happened on this last order also so shipping damaged goods is just part of their process ,0
i purchased this product from b r us when it was on sale and my son seems to like it i was scared of previous post of mold and i always double check the food before i stir and serve he seems to like it but i recommend the chicken sweet potato dinner ,1
i am not much of an avid tea guy i tend to drink tea more because of the health benefits than the taste but numi organic tea tastes better than most teas i have tried before thanks to a full taste that is never bitter and is almost worst drinking for the taste alone let alone all the health benefits that come along with drinking it ,1
i entered a chili cook off with this powder as my choice and took away a first place prize ,1

i went to a restaurant a few weeks ago and ordered some bratwurst they served a small cup with mustard on the side i was so impressed by the bold flavor that i decided to ask the wait staff what kind of mustard they served me i am throwing an oktoberfest party this weekend and decided to order this mustard to be featured in the party it is got a nice thick consistency and is very balanced i would say that it is not quite as strong as chinese mustard but areminds me of the strong stuff that clears your nasal passages this is not as flavorful as a stone ground mustard or something with a blend of mustard seeds it is not the standard horseradish mustard either it is very good though i can not wait to see how the party goers like it ,1
soy based meat products can often be a hit or miss affair but my family has consistently found the ll big franks product to be on the tasier side of the spectrum even through several manufacturer recipie modifications if you are looking for hot dogs for grilling however try the frozen morningstar veggie dog product for our taste big franks are much better at room temperature price wise buying through amazon is less expensive than at our local health food shop not even factoring in the free shipping vs gas used to physically go to the store ,1
i ordered this product for my mom she was looking for flour but could not find it anywhere else than on amazon well i was very happy to get it for her but was disappointed when i received the package what was shipped is and not as shown on the picture i did contact the seller and asked him about it and they said that sometimes ingredients can be different than shown on the picture well this is not a question of ingredients but a totally different product after a few emails back and forth and after i had to contact amazon the funds were refunded ,0
my recommendation is to stick with the k cups that are not instant coffee for a few more bucks you can get real coffee k cups and flavoured ones as well i will not be buying this product again ,0
my husband and i love this seasoning we first tried it at a friends house and we loved the flavoring on the chicken we then borrowed some and we could not stop talking about it nor stop cooking with it i came to amazon to see if they carried it and yes they did my friends didnt visit kenya often and the price they charge to bring over product or shipping and handling didnt make sense i first order at a time and then they told me my order could not go through i didnt think the quantity mattered so then i just put and then my order went through i know many others are ordering this spice and loves it just as much as we do yum yum yum i was looking for the chicken flavor but no luck ,1
very very nice flavor i add it when cooking rice instead of adding salt very good with beef dishes it adds a complexity to pot roast bottle of bad red wine added to the pot helps and beef gravies add to gravy made with beef base and demi glace for something really good to pour over a steak as for service hour after placing my order there was a knock on the door and here was my soupbase hand delivered though they are i found out just around the corner that is hard to beat ,1
i am a college student and i found this product in the campus store at first i was not sure about eating cheesy ramen but decided to give it a try the first impression was not that great then later i got a craving for it it is now one of my favorite instant lunches great for the busy college life and the tight budget i had tried a few of the other cheesy ramen brands but was very dissapointed if you want ramen and cannot get old fashioned japanese ramen then i recommend maruchan ,1
we tried to get kippers on subscribe and save but reviewers on the products we looked at mentioned that the pull ring frequently broke off the can making it impossible to open without a separate can opener not what we wanted so we tried these which are a win my husband loves them he says the taste is excellent and the price is terrific too because there are per case more than other brands he says and he has had no problem whatever opening the cans which was what motivated us to try these in the first place motto subscribe and save is fabulous but sometimes something not on subscribe and save is even better and many many thanks to reviewers of the other products who alerted us to the problem opening those cans ,1
i love this tea steeping it every morning has become almost a ritual i first tried it on a whim what a great choice and surprise ,1
my friend had this our last dinner party i liked it and purchased one it definitely helps the wine open up breath much quicker i only gave it stars because it leaks a little bit down the back of the stand which gets on the bottom of the wine glass everytime you use it you must wipe the bottom of the glass still a good buy if you drink wine ,1
this candy tastes like apple juice and vitamin c chews it is yummy and not unnaturally green like some other apple flavor hard candies actually not green at all it is brownish yellow love it ,1

i bought this coffee for my dad for fathers day he is yrs old and a die hard folgers drinker he is very hard to buy for and generally does not like anything new or different from the normal routine to my surprise he actually loves this coffee we are on our second pot this morning very smooth flavor no bitterness at all i would recommend it i am no coffee expert but i can tell when coffee is good and this is great coffee ,1

i bought this thinking ok if the kids dont drink this i will at least they will be getting their vitamin a along with more vitamin c than i have seen in any other juice drink not even getting into the other health benefits of vegetable and fruit juice so i hand it to them they suck it down like it was made of pure chocolate gold and ask for more in their lunch boxes the next day i am happy ,1
i thought people were so excited to find an alternative to the monopoly that they were going overboard but when i opened the seal and got a whiff of the dark rich coffee smell i was sold to add to the current comments this product arrives sealed in a large bag once you open it the seal is broken so it needs to be stored however you store loose coffee also this is an extremely dark coffee and pretty strong much darker and more flavorful than any other k cup i have tried if you prefer a milder coffee maybe try another of their roasts i am not an expert in coffee tasting i will just say that this is a very rich french roast with the slightly bitter aftertaste that is typical of that style i am not sure whether the reviewers who hated it were just not lovers of a dark roast or got a bad batch maybe a broken seal this is everything i love about my keurig an amazing cup of coffee any time i want one and none of the things i hate about it price gouging monopoly excessive waste ,1
i had an issue with this product after a note to the supplier it was corrected in less than a day i recommend this store,1
these jelly beans are very tasty have good flavor and were delivered fresh i would recommend them just to try a new jelly bean flavor ,1
i can not believe how much my cat loves these treats it is amazing he even knows when i say do you want some treats he gets these big eyes and gets so excited that he meows non stop i swear there has to be something addictive in these it is like crack for cats i never saw him act like this before lol ,1
i loved this annie chun lunch great blend of spicy and sweet i added a hard boiled egg for more protein i was also able to skip the microwaving part and just let it sit longer in the hot water from my kettle no problem draining it and keeping the spices in my one issue is that the calorie count for half a bowl is calories that is a high caloric count for my lunch so i can not justify this on a regular basis as great a packaged lunch as it was it seems the others who turned this into a dinner maybe even for were on the right track ,1
this meal in a box courtesy of kraft is quite tasty and very easy to make miles better than just macaroni and cheese you add in your own ground beef and some spices and cheese that comes in the box while i can not quite place the spices the net result was something that tasted exactly like one of my mother is home cooked meals the amount of cheese sauce was just right the meal was not overly cheesy but i could still get hints that something rich and creamy was lying underneath i threw some frozen peas and carrots into the mix to round out the meal and was able to get filling meals out of it move over hamburger helper i am totally going to buy these again ,1
the item i received was not the one pictured on the site and above right i only wanted the cat beds pictured then i had to pay to have the items returned i am very unhappy over the entire experience ,0
a distributor for foods here in vegas gave me a package to try and i fell in love with it i could not find it anywhere then i heard it might be a walmart and sure enough it was i bought two packages and just finished a big bowl of spaghetti on a hunch i checked amazon and lo and behold it is here and on prime no less another reviewer echoed my same feeling that it is the perfect blend of rice and corn so the corn does not overwhelm the sauce bravo i will be making this pasta our household standard from here on no more need to look this is it vicki in vegas,1
i remember my mom coming home with the distinctive jar of red cherry favorit she saw sitting on a shelf at ross making a point of telling me she managed to snag it for only five or so dollars where it might have been even more expensive outside i was a little thrown that it would be so expensive and hard to find how good could it be if i would never heard of it but one dollop of the stuff on a biscuit erased any doubt the preserves though very sweet have a good consistency are easy to spread and have an uncommonly strong and pure cherry flavor that had me carefully rationing the jar to make it last as long as possible it would be a long time before i saw another imagine my delight to find the brand on sale for three dollars a jar at harris teeter i bought several ,1
love this gum just want to note that i have purchased it both in the count jar and the count packages and there is a difference the gum in the jar was stiffer and harder to chew like it had dried out some the gum in the blisterpack type count package is much softer and fresher i would usually rather buy the product with less packaging but in this case i am buying the smaller packs from now on ,1
this stevia is just as good as the more expensive brand i have ordered it it is a quality product and the price is fantastic if anyone thinks it tastes bad but they like stevia they are probably using the wrong amount you have to play with it give it a chance ,1
this bag is a perfect fit for my garbage recycle basket i use the simple human rectangular shape receptcables it is great not having to dump my items directly into the garbage dumpster not the sturdiest bag do not over fill it but the best i have found for fit i would purchase it again ,1
the force will definitely be with you if you install one of these chargers this fence charger is perfect for keeping predators out and strong enough to pack a punch for those enclosed by it after one or two times of testing it my rough and rowdy bulldogs want no part of this system we have had this charger now for several months and it works like a charm also like the other poster says this unit is what the old timers used to call weed grass burners it is not susceptible to shorting out like other weaker units are when it comes to taller grass or weeds the heavy duty definitely applies here if you are looking for a good strong fence charger look no further i would give it stars if i could ,1
this tea is a rip off is not oz and tastes terrible i will never purchsae again and feel that amazon should remove it from it site due to ruining the reputation of amazon all other products have been great except this one ,0
i make alot of ice green tea and i was getting tired of using all those tiny tea bags this product is awesome a great taste of mint i really like it ,1

the only way to buy vanilla beans i make cakes and wanted to make my own vanilla extract i was a bit worried about quality but not anymore my extract months matured never came out so well before these vanilla beans were fantastic and bargain priced to boot ,1

my cats like this flavor of weruva best out of all the ones i have brought to them however i can not seem to find any made in the usa as it once was which is a bit of a downer i can only find it made in thailand ,1
this morning for the first time in my life i tried mahogani caribou coffee only because i had run out of my usual type of coffee which i would usually brew and drink in short i should not even categorize mahogany caribou as coffee you know why it has far more anti depressant and uplifting effect on me than i had previously anticipated from now on i will only drink mahogany caribou ,1
this is the best steal cut oats sure you can buy cheaper bulk oats at the health food store but they wont be irish oats these are the best and so good for you i add of brown sugar and that is just enought to enhance the flavor my spouse adds a tbls of peanut butter for an extra boose of protein i love mccann is totally worth the price ,1
i thought this would be the best for our mocha beverages so foolishly i purchased bottles it does not taste at all like white chocolate it is very sugary and also seems to be more a peppermint flavor so bad we tossed bottles and are now using only fontana which will taste identical to starbucks beverages the vendor i purchased the ghirardelli from was aware of the taste issue years ago when i bought this the taste was awesome must be they changed a great recipe to now something so off i do not know how they can call it white chocolate sauce and put their label on it cheaper than fontana yes but you will get cheap quality too ,0
add the eggs butter milk and whatever you want to fill it with and you can become an instant culinary genius ,1
when cooking according to instructions in microwave it keeps making popping noises and eventually it pops really loud and flies up and spills all over the place at about secs in my microwave wtf it has done it to me three times in a row then i tried it in my sisters microwave and had the same exact problem i am not sure this stuff is even safe ,0
great italian espresso flavor it is so real lavazza i will definitely recommend this to all espresso lovers ,1
got these first at a department store at christmas we enjoyed them so much we bought more great hostess gift so bought several ,1
look at the price hardly a bargain so i figured i would go to the new used i bought a case of monster for dollars that is just over a dollar a can unfortunatley the case was almost entirely used some of the cans were intact but most were half drunk and another three were entirely empty next time i am just going to buy a new case ,1
so i was looking for a healthier option than the oatmeal i was currently eating market pantry apple cinnamon reduced sugar this product has half the salt of my previous brand actually has more sugar but was not good at all i even tried adding at different times honey sugar and syrup none of these things helped this product was completely unpalatable and inedible i had other people try it and they had the same result i have just come across a way to make this edible adding peanut butter it is a simple fix but shows how it needs a complete flavor overhaul in order to be eaten i normally love whole grains i am not a sugar addict this product was just not good ,0
and it is soooo good if you like the tub of whipped topping at the grocery store but have food allergies or just an aversion to nasty ingredients like hydrogenated oils etc this is the whipped topping for you made from cashews and almonds this whipped topping adds that creamy yumminess without all the dairy or hydrogenated oils to your favorite desserts you simply put the box right in the freezer to get super cold but not frozen put the mixer bowl and beaters in the freezer to chill too then once cold whip up in your stand mixer for minutes and viola now hide it from the family or it will get gone before you have a chance to use it for its intended purpose ,1
i started my month old puppy on it and she instantly loved it i am happy with it because it is not full of undesirable fillers i research the dog food i put my dogs on and am pleased enough with this brand to put all my dogs on it thank you amazon for handling it ,1
despite the two good reviews on this product from others i had to put my two cents in and make it known that this product is not tasty its texture is grainy which is not good for potatoes or chicken the chicken was overly dry and salty and the real turn off was the flavorless gravy i am not a picky eater nor a connoisseur of fine meals but if i had the option of eating this or starving to death i would starve to death especially with a pack of six i suggest you try it before you buy in bulk it really is not palatable imho ,0
i bought a box of these because they were on sale and i am glad i gave them a try they have great flavor and texture and they are so light too my husband and i both enjoy them which i think says a lot that a man is willing to try them too give them a try they are a great snack and do not taste like a good for you i e cardboard snack ,1
these were so fresh and good i love them even with the pits i thought they were very tasty and moist i am going to order more of them and will enjoy eating baking and cooking with them very good ,1
i love muir glen their fire roasted crushed tomatoes even won a taste test on america is test kitchen i will say this however the current product description states carbohydrates free a ounce can has about twelve servings at grams of carbs per serving with gram of fiber for net carbs if you count that way since grams of all purpose flour will have around grams of carbs and gram of fiber you can consider them low carb but they are not carb free ,1
stash has blended a delicious green tea with other herbs and flavoring just delicious needing no sweetening or very little ,1
honey maid graham crackers are a staple in my home we have tried other brands but none can match the grahamy flavor honey maid while i was initially a bit disappointed the crackers do not come doubled up like the standard graham crackers it soon becomes clear why keeping the crackers smaller and more tightly packaged preserves the crisp quality of the crackers making them exceedingly fresh graham crackers have been around a long time they first were produced as a brand in by a presbyterian minister as a way of curbing unwanted carnal desire i did not realize that but while researching for this review i found that amusing while i can not say that graham crackers work that way for me they certainly do make a great snack to further the taste test on these crackers i offered some to my sister and mother and they were both quite pleased with the fresh crisp quality of these cookies ,1
i expected a bit more from the photo on the package we all know they exaggerate a bit but this was ridiculous i am not kidding there were maybe kernels of corn peas and broccoli no broccoli was in this there were some green flakes and maybe tiny dried tofu cubes the oriental noodles are spaghetti and mushy at that we did not overcooked them the flavor itself if tolerable if you get it be prepared to add a significant amount of veggies to it for it to resemble the photo on the packaging we will not be buying any of these products ,0
i ordered peeled plum tomatoes and received a pack of diced tomatoes instead every can has a dent in it which is not as big of a deal compared to not receiving what i ordered it would have been nice to have had the option of waiting on additional plum tomatoes if they were out of stock vs them sending me an alternate product not too happy about this ,0
these chews are tasty and chewy the price is excellent for what you get we have plenty around for ourselves and to share with family great treat for little kids plus they are good for you with no added junk just licorice great buy great taste ,1

our pack of dogs and their foster siblings are happily chomping away on their good buddy rawhide sticks while we are writing this review we have always trusted castor pollux products we rescued skinny sarcoptic mange puppies a while back and they thrived while getting fed needless to say we at wags dog walking pet sitting trust the brand and feel at ease knowing that our dogs are getting treats made in the us with lesser danger than the completely unmonitored products that are produced in china mexico argentina etc which in our opinion should be banned from being sold ,1
del monte makes a great product in the mixed fruit cups but an absolutely superb product in the diced peach cups just like mom used to can oh so many years ago the peaches are tart and sweet at the same time i am not sure if it can get any better than this both products are very convenient in the ounce plastic cups they cool fast in the fridge do not take up a lot of room the lids remove easily and the cups and lids are easy to dispose of thanks amazon for providing this product and making it seem easy too ,1
wow this stuff is full body shake gross it has a very unnatural gross sweetness and i can not even find words to describe the disgusting mango pineapple flavor it sounded so good two of my favorite flavors and i love tea but i can not make myself drink another sip of this grossness wish i had not been roped in by the lightning deal this is going in the trash save your money ,0

soothing tea great before bed i have gotten other people to like it helps with stomached i will continue to buy ,1
while i often cook different types of curry from scratch sometimes we need something quick and easy these chickpeas became a favorite quick meal in our house my husband and i will split it and pair it with some basmati or brown rice sometimes i even throw in some chicken short cuts that i have on hand the sodium is high but if you are not regularly eating sodium laden foods then once in awhile should not be that big of a deal i do not think it is overpoweringly spicy but then again my husband and i love spicy foods so it probably does not make me a good judge of the spice level i think it does take an adventurous palette as do many things but i would recommend that it is at least worth a try i think the price on amazon is good too a box whereas in the grocery store i have paid will be ordering from amazon in the future ,1
i usually do not write reviews but compelled to do so this is not chow mein noodles my order has packs and all of them are small bits instead of lengthy noodles like how chow mein noodles is supposed to be this is like someone bought scrap noodle leftovers that are broken and made an item out of when i tried to return it says this item is not eligible for returns i thought all items bought from amazon are returnable well i learned my lesson the hard way stay away from this brand ,0
i use spry xylitol gum regularly for a variety of reasons i have tried all flavors and this is by far the worst with a strong artificial taste try one of the natural flavors two stars instead of one just because it is xylitol ,0
while all flavors of bai are tasty the blueberry is my favorite so far these drinks have tons of flavor but are not too sweet the high amount of antioxidants from the coffee fruit is just an added bonus to this already delicious drink ,1
i am a vegetarian and this is the best not beef bouillon i have ever used and better than most of the real beef bouillons out there you would never know that there is not any beef in it even has a bit of fat that is very nice in my gravies and and vegan products i prepare gives your vegan burgers a nice flavor and excellent in all of my sauces that are suppose to mimic a beefy flavor i guess the next thing i will try are the not chicken bouillon at amazon so glad that amazon carries this as i can not find anything that comes close to it in my little meat and potatoes town thanks ,1

in the four ounce package are fourteen wraps chunks of dried sweet potato wrapped in what looks like duck jerky inside the package is a small package of moisture absorber a desiccant not the kind of addition one normally finds in a food product pet food or otherwise the wraps are not visually appealing to a human but dogs will only be concerned with the scent and the taste on the top of the pouch is a tear off strip to open it a resealable plastic zipper seals the pouch tightly to keep the wraps fresh our three girls wear their emotions on their paws and their faces thus when each was presented with a duck sweet potato wrap their interest and their excitement were unmistakable there were no sniffy sniffy hesitations no circle walkings no signs of disinterest and definitely no looks of can not youdobetterthan this evie immediately grabbed her wrap between her jaws and began chewing oblivious to the world piper and bella the two shih tzus grabbed their wraps eagerly and slunk off to their respective corners for some private feasting piper in particular had a primal transformation guarding her prize with laid back ears and a low stay away growl hovering over her wrap like a miniature wolf guarding its kill all three dogs were in a state of ravenous wrapture with their treats i like that these wraps are too chewy for the dogs to finish off quickly though evie the vac nonterrier finished hers in half the time as her two little sisters the duck jerky was eaten first followed by the sweet potato piece with no lessening of interest or enjoyment of all the many treats and chews offered to this canine triumvirate few have elicited such intense enthusiasm and prehistoric passion we noticed no ill side effects in any of the pooches from these treats there were no upset tummies and no bouts of diarrhea the verdict of this jury was unanimous and definitively pawsitive ,1

i have used this rice pudding for three years for under the weather or lazy days it is slightly low sugar but tasty and easy on the tummy i usually get two or three servings from a can worth every penny when mom is not around to give tlc or when a mom is too busy to cater to the simpler needs of a child or adult ,1

the pudding is fine i have tried it before but this order arrived in a big box and several puddings had broken open and fruit flies had discovered them i had to throw out the entire case so it was a waste of money for me ,0
i like these for several reasons one is that they are tasty another is that i am not pouring cold creamer into my hot coffee besides some people do not want creamer cold nor powdered another is that they are easy to pack along in my purse another is that i can make flavored iced coffee with them using milk rather than cream or creamer i have not had trouble with opening them which may be just a difference in technique i have found it helpful to hold them upside down over my cup and just rip letting the contents spill into the cup ,1
these beef sticks are a great snack perfect sized sticks great for camping and also goes good with beer ,1

these are very flavorful little cookies something you can eat and not feel bad about since they are small and have healthier than average ingredients for a cookie i do not know if the other varieties would be as flavorful since the orange flavor is there in every bite the chewy bits of cranberry are a pleasant surprise they are great with a cup of earl grey tea looking forward to trying the chocolate raspberry ,1
i have loved pamela is products for many years and the bread mix is a real hit with my family we miss homemade bread but gluten free baking can be complicated i am glad there is a mix that takes care of all the intricate mixing of flour and makes things easy for me putting it together in the morning takes about minutes yay the taste is really yummy too soft moist and even textured not like the stale bricks that pass for gluten free bread in the store we really like this mix and the amazon price is a real break from the high cost of purchasing it locally one note about allergens pamela is is gluten free but not necessarily free of other allergens if you have other food sensitivities be sure and read the latest ingredient list on pamela is website or locate a package at your local health food store and read the ingredient list carefully amazon does not always post ingredient lists and when they do they are sometimes inaccurate i would post the ingredients myself but companies often change their recipes and i would hate for something i write represent an obsolete formula in a year or two anyway if gluten is your only issue this could be a wonderful bread mix enjoy ,1
i had a recipe that called for a lot of dark chili powder and the only place i could find it was amazon com i bought a jar of this and it made two batches of the chili recipe i have the chili was the best i would ever made i can vouch that this chili powder really does make a big difference in the flavor of a chili it is rich with a bit of a kick everyone has been crazy for it and i think its due to this chili powder i am back to buy the bag this time ,1

wow i bought this tea not to sure what to expect boy was i glad that i did it has a nice and sweet taste to it but it is not overly sweet it is just right when you buy this and put it in the water and mix it do not be thrown if it looks pale it looked pale to me and thought it would taste weak that is not the case if you like peach or mango tea then you know what to expect if you have not tried this before trust me it is outstanding o ,1
i use this product instant coconut cream pudding for an original recipe and for some odd reason none of the groceries in albuquerque carry this particular flavor of jell o pudding therefore i found it necessary to order it on lineas with all of the jell o products the results are perfect every time it is good to know that you never have to worry about the quality of the products you are using and that the results are going to be perfect ,1

unbeleivable people are so gullible no these treats are not toxic to your dogs but they certainley are not healthy either just because sugar and fat taste good does not mean you should feed it to your dog get a clue and check out the ingredients in the treats and food you feed your dog and even though some things are healthy for humans does not mean they are for dogs e g soy and corn try thinking for yourself and doing your own research search dog food advisor ,0
this is one of my favorite ceylon teas it is really smooth and well balanced not too strong it has a very subtle hint of orange it goes well with milk or without great tea ,1
i love this product it is a strong dark roast full of flavor with a wonderful aroma not for the feint of heart my only problems with this coffee are no one carries it locally so i can only get it through amazon not really a problem and i zoom through a box of it way too fast because it is soooooo good ,1
i could smell the nuts right when i opened the box of cereal it smelled quite tasty the cereal itself is also pretty yummy not too sweet not to not sweet and just nutty enough the only thing that would make it better is it it stayed crunchy in the milk longer but most cereals have this problem the flakes are small just the right size i would definitely buy this again ,1
i have some nice mics round my place for video and thought i could use them to help my skype chats and for the money it is amazing little usb device ,1
i agree with all the other positive reviews here i too discovered this blend from a single pouch offered as part of a selection at a restaurant it has the flavor of black tea without the acidity the notes of fruit offer just a hint of sweetness and does not dominant the flavor which i like i am not a fan of fruity herbal teas after brewing i mix this dark rich tea with warm milk to make a tea latte for morning tea i do not think i could make this a blend i drink every day but i do enjoy having it around for variety ,1
ooma is is delicious pure and simple i have tasted most marinara is out there and ooma is is the best made by hand in the berkshires true italian sauce fresh and no added filler ingredients i have a jar waiting in my cabinet at all times delicious with pasta fish seafood eat with fresh bread yum buy it try it eat it it will not disappoint it will become a culinary staple in your kitchen i hope ooma tesoro is makes more products ,1
i followed the directions precisely but the end result was the same as using other pre made gf crusts using a gf flour blend palm shortening ice water salt the crust looks and feels flaky but when the fork hits your mouth it dissolves into a grainy pasty mush you either need to spit out or drink a glass of milk to get down i do not know what needs to be added to give it the elasticity and ability to hold together but whatever it is this mix does not have it ,0
these are so good i was looking for a light snack that i can keep in my purse for those times my blood level gets low i first tried the brown sugar and cinnamon i then went back for the strawberry and blueberry all are really good crips thin and they do remind me of poptarts but smaller and no guilt my least favorite is chocolate i am waiting for apple to come out or even a better flavor pineapple that would be yummy i gave one to a friend who was flying one day and she really liked it i also asked a friend at work if she had tried these and she said yes that they are too good i let her try my blueberry and she loved it you can not go wrong when you want a little snack that will not throw you off your diet but just be careful as stated before in a review you can go overboard with these at first because they are so good pace yourself and you will be fine ,1
this is less a review of yogourmet is freeze dried starter and more of a clarification of the value i mean how much is there to say about a starter it either works or it does not when i ordered my yogourmet yogurt maker it came with a box of the freeze dried starter the box contained double packets of yogurt a single packet will do the job for a quart of yogurt and a double packet is needed if you are doing a full two quart batch long story short i thought i was just purchasing a box of double packets when i read the description pack of that seemed a little pricey at it turns out that that this item is actually boxes of starter each with double packets i just wanted to clarify that in case you skimmed through the product description too quickly like i did happy yogurt making ,1
i have wanted one of these since i saw it in an overpriced kitchen store last summer i do not seem to have any luck growing herbs from seed and keeping them alive this neat little machine had the seeds started in no time at all some of the plants grow faster than others but i have just been trimming them down to let others catch up working very well so far i find it wonderful to have fresh herbs at hand in the winter i just set it up less than four weeks ago and i already got to use my basil the only thing is to set the light timer to go off around bed time it is incredibly bright ,1
have been purchasing this tuna for some time now price varies so try to find it when the price is low delicious quality tuna this brand is not available where i live just another reason i love amazon thank you amazon ,1
i use this product to supplement my protein intake i also eat fish and yogurt for protein i mix this product in a shaker with white grapefruit juice the red or pink grapefruit juice is too sweet i like the taste and also the energy boost from this product it does taste very earthy but that is fine i drink the protein shakes thru the night at work and i have plenty of energy i do not drink any caffeine and have plenty of energy i highly recommend this product try it with the white grapefruit juice too ,1
great system for brewing your daily coffee and the medium roast coffee fits my taste accordingly i will continue to purchase this product from amazon it is shipped on a consistant basis each month ,1
yeast is a matter of taste bread will taste differently with different yeasts before buying this buy a packet in a market around and try it out for my tastes and apparently for the tastes of my friends this is the best yeast i have used and i have used all of those usually found in super markets and some from foreign food stores i bake bread about every four days so for me this package is a great buy it is the same yeast you pay for a jar this is a win win makes good bread at a very low price if the quantity is just too much for you split it up with bread baking friends ,1
gaffney says yummy mom can i have more i already had and that is enough i do not think so please give me more please please please ,1
this is bite size granola in a package that can be eaten a few at a time as a snack each package is oz and there are ten ounce servings in each bag each serving is calories with calories from fat there are grams of protein and grams of sugar in each serving each serving also constitutes a daily dietary intake of in fiber and in carbs the first three ingredients are whole grain rolled oats brown sugar and walnuts cranberries are on the ingredient list i am use to eating my granola with milk so this was a new twist on a what was formally a cerael i felt these were dry but they tasted good drinking a glass of milk took away most of the dryness there is a high cocoa and cinnamon flavor and the cranberries tasted like raisins to me i did not taste the walnuts at all as a result i felt the flavor was a bit muted but still good obviously granola is a high calorie snack and it is hard to eat just ounces nevertheless i feel it is much better to eat this than candy and cake after having tried these this is not a snack i would purchase because of the dryness and the muted flavor however i have been eating these for a couple of days and have discovered that putting these clusters in a salad takes away the dryness and gives the salad a nice crunch like croutons in addition to adding additional flavor i had my boyfriend try these and he likes them ,1
needless to say not all black teas are the same barry is is a very strong irish blend and is meant to be drank with lots of milk and sugar the previous reviewer who calls him herself a notea snob seems to have hoped barry is would be like all the other black teas he she likes and has rated barry is so low because it tastes different if you like a very strong irish breakfast style tea strong and with lots of tanin then you will like barry is if not stay away and i disagree it is very consistent in flavor from bag to bag maybe you are not preparing it consistently i am not even saying barry is is my favorite irish blend lyon is is also very good but it is unfair to rate it so low because you were uninformed about how it is supposed to taste in the future i suggest you stick with red rose if that is what you know you like ,1
yum yum tried this product based upon the many positive reviews here it creates a wonderful delicious moist somewhat dense chewy loaf of bread in my machine much much better than store bought gf loaves that we have tried satified even kids with sensory issues am purchasing another case today pancake mix wonderful too ,1
coconut water is definitely an acquired taste which is why it is only a star rating however post workout this stuff is fantastic i used to get muscle cramps after a long hard workout but one box of this and they no longer occur also drinking this after a night of alcohol either before bed or first thing in the morning or both is a great hangover remedy ,1
this is without a doubt the best instant oatmeal on the market i have been buying this at my local sav a lot but they quit carrying it and i can not find it in the rural area i live in i am glad to find it here but it is really overpriced i was getting a box of five packets for cents worth it though at least until i can find another grocery store that carries it i have tried many of the other flavors as well all are good but the maple brown sugar is my favorite it cooks up like the old fashioned oats not mushy like the other brands try it with just a few walnuts added in the flax seeds in it are a good source of nutrients and make it interesting to eat too it fills me up with no mid morning crash love it ,1
these are awesome it is the only way i can get a pill down my cat twice a day the other cats beg to have one just as a treat ,1
my mouth watered as i eagerly anticipated ordering this just thinking of what it could taste like i am a heavy drinker of bigelow is eggnog n tea so i could not even guess what this could taste like i received the package and eagerly brewed a cup and overall was pleased but it did not taste how i had imagined i noticed in another review that they said it tasted a bit like chemicals for the first bag i could see where they would interpret a certain aftertaste to be somewhat like a chemical but i have not since after a few cups not one after another mind you throughout a couple weeks it just tastes like some sort of hot chocolate even looks that way when i add a bit of soymilk and sugar overall i give it a its not amazing it is not bad i suppose i just do not have acute tasting skills but i honestly do not differentiate it too much from a cup of hot chocolate i actually did put a bag in a cup of hot chocolate and it was definitely a chocolaty heaven all in all it is good i am sure i will go through all boxes eventually but i can not say that i will be ordering more after that as for the eggnog n however that is an entirely different story if you are debating on this i say order a small box to give it a try then graduate to the package if you are blown away ,1
the closest thing i can compare this to is just a handful of mixed nuts and dried fruit except it is clustered together i am pretty sure it is the dried fruit that holds everthing together it says there is a tiny bit of cane sugar syrup here but it is so little that it hardly shows up but the nuts are crispy and fresh the fruits are minced soooooo small it is just yummy none of that cloying sugary ness of so many of the bars and nut fruit snacks out there just light and crispy crunchy great as a snack alone or crubled up on a salad or on top of yogurt or frozen yogurt i have never seen these in stores down here in texas but i will keep looking i can not wait to try other flavors ,1
i bougt these for my diabetic girlfriend and they were not the hit i was hoping they would be she ate less than half the box in matter of few weeks and threw the rest away the taste was not good and she stated they left an aftertaste i would not recommend this although i do not know of any sugar free candy that does taste good ,0
i recently went on weight watchers and was missing peanut butter then i picked some of this stuff up at trader joe is and was changed for life its consistency is so good creamier than peanut butter my friend with me said it tasted like the peanut butter in a reese is i would never guess that one tbsp is just one weight watcher is point it is sweet and creamy and hits the spot on a sandwich apple slices celery sticks or my favorite a spoon ,1
these green mountain caramel vanilla cream k cups make good tasting coffee with noticeable but not overpowering caramel and vanilla flavors these make a nice alternative to to our regular coffee ,1
when we first bought these we tried to eat one and could not looked at the ingredients and found its mostly pig hearts taste is awful our dog however thinks they are great so we cut them up in small pieces and hide them around for him or forage out by smell after about a week the contents of the bag start to mold since they are for the dog we washed them off and then store in the fridge too bad we had hoped these would be good snacks for football parties etc not recommended for people food ,0
these candies taste better than i expected build well the kids loved it excellent addition to our lego party lbs is less than you would expect but still enough that all the kids got some to take home and some was used decoratively and we still have some left ,1
we just got a new dog she is just about a year old and could be classified as an agressive chewer she loves these bones and they stand up to her chewing she loves it and i love that she is spending her chew time on the nylabone rather than my furniture ,1
i love green mountain coffee i use it all the time for my k cups i got a sample of the green mountain hot cocoa and thought it would be the best i actually threw it out i tried several times to drink it it tasted bitter and like chemicals i have tried samples of the other brands of hot cocoa and this by far was the worst i was so surprised because i adore their coffee i personally would not recommend this maybe it is the soy i do not know it just tasted very very odd i still would recommend their coffees though just to be fair i did add chocolate redi whip but i add that to all of my hot cocoa and it always tastes good ,0
love it what an awesome concept no more searching for a bowl that is large enough to fit the popcorn no need to wash the bowl afterwards why go through that trouble when the bag conveniently turns into the pop corn bowl it is very convenient tastes great too just like orville redenbacher is always does i highly recommend it did i mention whole grain only con i see here is that there could have been a little more popcorn in each bag to fill the bowl up a little higher ,1
this stuff is absolutely wonderful while it is great delivered on a chip my black bean soup would not be the same without it a cup to a cup and a half in a fairly large batch of pinto or black bean soup is what i typically use yum ,1
i only wanted the best for my little nutmeg so i did some searching online i started out giving her friskes and then i got fancy feast i read that to give her the best i should try wellness well i did wellness indoor health is wonderful she is a short hair but i was combing her almost everyday and she could get very hairy i noticed immediately she is less hairy and her fur is softer and she is much more happier my girl never complains about much with one exeception she will not eat chicken beef just fish fish fish and i rather keep it that way that is what cats should eat wellness works well her system i mixed wellness with a little fancy feast since i purchased it might as well make use of it and she gobbles it up she is so healthy and happy with wellness indoor health ,1
my entire family agrees that this cucina antica garlic marinara sauce is the most delicious prepared tomato sauce we have ever eaten way better than rao is for example so good that my old daughter asks for a bowl of it straight up to eat like a soup ,1
i got these for under ten bucks and they worked out to just a tad over two dollars a pound which is excellent i rarely see peanuts for any less than that even on sale i have been buying planters for years so i knew what to expect and am perfectly happy with the freshness and taste their expiration is a year away i was concerned about that huge jar either i was going to plow through them way too fast or in my effort to be conservative i might end up with stale peanuts so i took an old clean ounce jar i had and poured a pound of peanuts into that and put the remaining half pound in a container in the refrigerator to save for later the essential story on peanuts having read this on line somewhere is that as soon as you break the seal they begin to lose freshness refrigeration can slow that down ,1
not much to say here literally a cardboard shipping box filled with k cups looked like somebody just grabbed a handful and just threw them in a box and sent them off this may not bother some but to me this is poor presentation i would have expected something similar to what you find in stores an individual manufacturer is type boxing sent in a shipping box frankly i worried about the integrity of the product how would i know who or where this product came from for all i know someone picked them from a refused batch and simply threw them in a box and called it good additionally upon further inspection the k cups looked a little dirty it appeared that they had collected dust not sure if this was due to the packaging or simply bad product i guess that is about it i can not really speak to the actual coffee itself since i did not try it i should be fair and say upon calling amazon with my concern they were happy to refund me entirely and asked that i dispose of the product since it is a non returnable item i will be tossing this ,0
i had to switch food from merricks to california natural because after two years of feeding my dogs merricks food it seems like they are having problems with their pancreas the food may be a little too oily after feeding them california natural for the first time they loved it they finish all their food every meal too bad they dont make the small bites in chicken and rice formula i have three to dogs so the small bites makes it easy for them to chew ,1
i have had various different varieties of bottled tea drinks over the years and none have ever been the perfect blend until now chantea is aloe vera green tea passion fruit is the first time i have had the perfect bottled tea drink why do i think it is the perfect taste the balance between the strength of the tea and the strength of the fruit flavors is right on the nail typically what i have experienced from other bottlers is either the tea flavor is too strong or the additional flavors are weak or fake if i could i would fill the garage with cases of it if you want an authentic flavor in a refreshing size this is the drink for you ,1
i just ordered and received this flavor of k cups it has become my favorite and will be reordering again soon ,1
warning do not buy this product from amazon in the summer if if you live in a warm climate the chocolate chips will melt while the box sits on the delivery truck other than that i thought this was a pretty tasty product and the price is not too bad either my kids liked it but mostly they gobbled up the chocolate bits and left a lot of granola crumbs give it a try ,1
these seem to hit the spot for any dog in my neighborhood and not just my own so i would reccomend them as an altenative to the other biscuits that may not be so healthful for doggies ,1
these brownies are awesome i found out i have a wheat allergy about a month ago my first gf brownie mix i tried was pamela is they were gritty and just not like the brownies i was used to i only ate one and threw the rest of the pan out i saw the good reviews of the betty crocker brownies on amazon so i took a risk on a pack of i am thrilled to report these brownies are easy to make add stick butter and eggs and most importantly they are delicious i can definitely bring these to family gatherings and other events without others suspecting a thing i am so thrilled and the price is a lot better than the other gluten free brownie mixes out there ,1
i bake times per week and honestly can say that this product is great i tried it for the first time to make bread i almost cried my bread was the best i ever made i will buy it again for sure ,1
this is defnitely better than trying to grow your own saffron it is a large amount of saffron for cooking use at about a jar this is an excellent price when you look at spending in the grocery store for a single use ,1
tomatoes came well packed but one can had a dent in it they are delicious and much better than regular canned tomatoes we can probably buy them as cheap if we watch our sales and combine with a senior day discount but this was very convenient ,1
excellent grape laces are what i snack on when i am watching that special movie or tv program or when i am just chillin ,1
this is one of the better k cups i usually do not like bold coffee but it takes a bold k cup for me to get a good cup of coffee ,1
i absolutely love this flavor it is so nice to be able to drink a diet soda and not get a migraine afterwards it is all natural and there is little to no aftertaste for my taste this could have a bit more of the grapefruit flavor but it is by far my favorite of the zevia line it reminds me a bit like fresca in that nice crisp refreshing flavor ,1
these energy plus candies are really tasty they taste like a hard caramel which eventually gives way to a soft honey center they have a modest amount of vitamins in each drop of your daily recommended value of two of your b vitamins and also c i do not notice any vitamin flavor which is nice the sugar content is pretty moderate gm mostly because you are spending a long time sucking on a small portion i enjoy having these around during my work day i find that small hard candies are a nice little treat and energy boost throughout the day for long days doing computer work in my case likes very tasty moderate sugar and calories minutes of enjoyment for gm sugar and calories b vitamins give me an energy boost natural ingredients sugar corn syrup milk honey butter natural flavors b c vitamins dislikes the gooey center is a personal preference sometimes i wish these were solid so they would last longer and not be quite so sweet at the end ,1
my kids really like making their own ice cream i would suggest using a heavy cream instead of half and half to make the ice cream richer ,1
i just got this in today because i am tired of paying bucks for earth mama angel baby mothers milk so i decided to try this i started drinking mothers milk because exclusively breastfed babies during growth spurts you feel like your not producing enough my month old daughter had growth spurts already second one being the longest reaching a week first growth spurt awful which was before the tea second was a breeze because i was producing more than enough now before the tea my supply was fine but i wanted to increase it so i can pump and store this is a god send ladies do not give up breastfeeding is tough but i promise it gets better with time remember its liquid gold that is so good for your bundle of joy and your baby is learning how to become efficient so say it to yourself my daughter is a eater if she could she would be attached to me sometimes i feel like eleven from hr feeds to minutes now i swear it gets better stay strong ,1
the shipping charge was free and the transaction was smooth and quick the product is fresh and easy to order will order again and recommend ,1
i often cannot find the raspberry jello in the supermarket i use it to make raspberry fig preserves as i have heavily bearing fig trees the raspberry has the best flavor in my opinion over cherry and strawberry others must agree as they keep asking for more preserves ,1
i love the mango whole nuts and coconut in these bars they are perfect for a mid day snack my year old granddaughter is always asking if she can take one for snack break at school ,1
gluten free egg free and dairy free yet these taste exactly like cones from an ice cream shop if you do not tell them they will never know these are gluten free ,1
my dog would not eat these and neither would my daughter is two dogs i do not know what it is about the flavor but they did not like them ,1
i had dark circles and uneven skin before i used this product it works well it is kind of on the expensive side for something so little though ,1
we tried this flavor when my son was almost months and he would not eat it it is too sour even for me i have talked to customer service and they had complains from other people and the next batch will have more sweet potato in so it should taste better i will give it try again when the new batch is out otherwise my son loved all the other flavors we tried so far pear mango spinach pear pear peas broccoli apple cherry banana beat blueberries so try one before ordering bunch on amazon the pouch idea is great so easy to travel with some of the flavors are little runny but i am using boon spoon and it works great i am also going to try out the plum organic boon spoon for pouches should fit happy baby pouches as well ,1

this product used to be available at our local large grocery store chains primarily shaw is and hannaford within the past year or so i have been unable to purchase this particular variety although they still carried others such as the vanilla almond and the flax version not sure if there was pressure from special k which offers a similar but not quite as good product or not nevertheless because i already get regular shipments of my husband is favorite cereal mccann is instant irish oatmeal maple brown sugar also previously available locally but no longer i searched amazon to find out if newman is own flakes n strawberries would be available after a few months i was notified it had been added and got right on it the shipment comes in a pack as soon as i get down to my last box it will not be long i will sign up for the automatic shipments and save even more money the cereal itself has a nicely crunchy slightly sweetened remember it says sweet enough on the box flake larger and crunchier than the competition is version and there are more and larger pieces of strawberries it is hands down my favorite dry cereal because i always like more sweetness i add some splenda but that is only my preference and it certainly is sweet enough for the average cereal eater i also like the fact that the profits go to charity ,1
i love the grill alert the first proble lasted about three years i have now had this replacement probe for approximately months it works great it was a little risky in that it is hard to tell if the probe is defective or the actually device it hooks too did some research online and was convinced it probably was the probe worked out good for me ,1

what we were hoping for something a little more like the picture we were especially excited to try chocolate glazed donut and pumpkin spice what we hazelnut caramel vanilla french wild mountain cinammon southern butter mocha nut french vanilla supremesadly we already have entire boxes of wild mountain blueberry and caramel vanilla creme and the ones we were most interested in from this bunch we only got one or two of my mistake for not reading the reviews but i disagree with the guy who said that the description covers the sellers behind when it comes to variety the description says that a buyer will get a wide variety and i hardly think flavors comprising more than half of the package qualifies as wide variety i am extremely disappointed with this purchase if i would have bought these flavors on the keurig website i would have paid less per k cup than i paid for this package and i paid the higher price specifically for the variety i do not feel i got what i paid for and i think amazon should not allow this seller to continue falsely advertising final note the k cups came in a paper bag with no visible expiration dates one of them was punctured on top considering some of the other reviews i am worried about whether or not these k cups are even good anymore some of the other reviews suggest that at least some people received theirs in a box with expiration dates included ,0
ashame that amazon will not offer this product at subscribe and save anymore it broke my heart is a fantastic instant coffee better than anything out there in the market no comparison ,1

this is the best product for natural curly hair eliminates friz and is not stiff or sticky i have tried tons of products and this is by far the best for my hair the only problem is that it is not in the stores anymore i was thrilled to find it on amazon and for a much better price ,1
i did not realize that this actually had the bones in it not something that i would give to any dog let alone a yorkie and a poodle the bones take up a lot of room in the can the rest of the can contains little cubes of meat a few vegetables and lots and lots of gravy i usually split half a can between the two dogs the only way i am able to get another meal out of the can is to add more cooked vegetables the dogs really like it but i will not buy this flavor again you are getting less for your money since it contains bones and so much gravy i would recommend the turducken they absolutely love that one ,0
i love nature valley is chewy trail mix cranberry pomegranate bars unfortunately i became addicted to them by eating them as a meal and sometimes as a late night snack i receive them thru amazon is subscribe save program but instead of every month i changed it to every three months these bars are great tasting and i crave no other sweets or salty products if i have these bars available still they are addictive ,1
i used to buy buttermilk in liquid form and would often not finish it all before it went bad it took up room in my fridge and i did not use it enough having the powder is really handy because i have it ready for my bread machine recipes many actually call for the powdered form or spur of the moment pancakes etc i totally agree with the person who said this is great for milk baths too sometimes i do not bake as much as i thought or i get another shipment before i am finished with the last and i end up with expired or excess buttermilk i put a capful or two of my son is tangerine baby bubble bath and shake some buttermilk in and get softer skin than with any of the bath products i have tried in the past ,1
i have never used tvp before this so i was not sure quite what to expect when i purchased this product so far i have used one whole bag and i could not be happier with it my whole family enjoys eating the food i have made with tvp instead of ground beef and so far i have not noticed any stomach issues in anyone even the baby and though i was a little unnerved by another reviewer is comment on the smell i did not really notice anything more than a subtle grain scent when i put my nose in the bag the first thing i did with my tvp was to take the liquid left from making a pot roast in my crockpot skim away most of the fat and use the liquid to rehydrate the tvp it made a really delicious meatloaf tasting crumble that we ate in sandwiches with ketchup a few days later i made a homemade spaghetti sauce with tvp simmered right in and that turned out great too i did notice that the tvp made the recipe just a little sweeter than it would have been but i compensated with extra spices i would leave the sugar out of the sauce recipe next time i make it with tvp and last night i rehydrated the last cup of tvp in the bag with water i would mixed a packet of taco seasoning into it made a very serviceable taco meat substitute for beefy taco macaroni and cheese just from my one bag one quarter of my order i got three meals for my family which works out to less than seventy five cents of tvp per meal i do not know that i will ever try to actually make a hamburger with this but i just love it for any recipe calling for ground beef instead of defrosting and cooking a pound of beef rehydrating a cup of tvp is fast and simple i will definitely buy this again ,1
this arrived quickly and in great shape i feed this to my dogs however i personally did not find the contents unpleasant or visibly lacking in quality i liked what i saw and smelled much better than the roland brand my dogs love it ,1
i recently received a sample through influenster and really enjoyed it the one that i received is oz and calories it is absolutely delicious it is super soft but also has crunchy bits like a health bar the banana nut flavor is prominent it suggests warming it up on the package and i am sure that is delicious but after the first little bite i kept on eating till my bar was gone so i did not get a chance to try it warmed up i will keep my eye out for it in the stores to get me a couple boxes and let the whole family try it ,1
we use agave all the time now we sweeten with organic agave organic sugar ,1

i have been a tea drinker for years and have always felt i was buying good tea when i bought the celestial in the grocery story once i tried yogi tea i was hooked i started it while going on a juice fast and needed energy and something to hold me from one meal to the next this tea is perfect it is great to take to work for breaks and just at home in the morning to get me up and moving i have totally stopped drinking coffee and use my coffee maker to heat up water in the morning for my tea i love the flavor not fond of minty flavors and it really seems to help me last from meal to meal i no longer need a caffeine fix in the morning and my day often starts at a m for work i need all the energy i can get to get through a day at work i have also lost weight which has been a battle after age the tea with other sensible weight lose plans really has worked this will always be my favorite while also trying the other teas ,1

i had actually bought this at a supermarket store and went home to make a white mocha i usually drink starbucks so thats what i was going for to me this prduct is gross and not that good i really reccomend the fontana sauces and syrups that is the best product in my opinion and it is the same stuff starbucks uses ,0
this is probably the best tasting zero calorie flavored water ive ever had becareful though this does have sugar alcohol in it and if you have too much it can cause bowel discomfort ,1
i used to eat a lot of this when i first discovered the pleasure of oatmeal about a year ago now i make my own using quaker is old fashioned oats or target is cheaper equivalent which takes only minutes or so allows me to control the sweetness to my liking by adding the maple syrup and brown sugar myself and does not give me any artificial flavors or guar gum or caramel color given that i will say that for an instant product this is pretty good though just a bit too sweet for me its first ingredient is whole grain rolled oats although the second is sugar and it does have a reasonably creamy consistency which you would expect from oatmeal i actually preferred quaker is high fiber variation of this product ,1
great product i gifted to my boss for christmas its green neon color makes the teapot fun and classy i highly recommend this product ,1
i like popcorn i like hot things this stuff has just the right heat and is pretty addicting i always eat the whole bag in one sitting if you like a burning tongue a runny nose and cayenne pepper like fumes in the air get this stuff ,1
disappointed that the bottles were plastic i have only seen glass bottles in the local store they were all covered in a powdery residue and sticky like another bottle had broken in the master case syrup itself is great as always but i will drive out of my way to get a glass bottle next time ,1
the drinks arrived quickly i love kombucha tea i usually brew my own tea however my kitchen is too cold in the winter to brew the tea this tastes as good as my own home brewed tea and as good as gt s tea the price is reasonable i like the small size i will order again thank you for the service ,1
great treats pretty small so i get lots of training and repetition they also sell a smaller variety specific to training your dog very fragrant dog comes from anywhere to seek them out not something to hide in your pocket or all of the neighborhood dogs will be smelling your leg ,1
good tasting caviar i think i personally like the eggs when they are larger in this caviar the eggs are small but all the same a tasty and well priced item ,1
these are one my favorite kind of sun chips they have a zesty taste that is not too sharp or bland with just the right kick and a nice crisp texture while these are not a health food their sodium and fat content is much better than other snack foods these chips work really well with a dip and vegetables for a pre dinner snack shop for price the price printed on the oz bag that i buy at my local supermarket is and i pay less on sale so the price on amazon is higher than the manufacturer is suggested retail price ,1
i second this out of stars soupy and poor tasting october robert j mulholland franklin park nj united states see all my reviews real name there is so much watery sauce in this product it is tough to find the mini ravioli which are so small they barely fit anything inside unlike the picture on the outside of the bowl which makes them look packed with meat ,0
i have been drinking ravens brew coffee since when someone on the docks in ketchikan told me to try it i am proud to say i was one of their first mail order customers when i had them mail it to me in kansas their coffee is smooth not burnt tasting and obviously made with love and care the packaging is thoughtful and hysterical three pecker billygoat for example the graphics are beautiful i even have a poster of the original ravens brew raven coming out of the coffee cup i saw a review on here about fraudulent posts i think that is just plain weird i have been to their roastery i am a real person and i think this coffee is amazing so hey old sour berry guy get over it and have a cup of ravensbrew to soothe your bitter soul try this coffee but be aware that you will be hooked on it as they say on the packaging it is the last legal high ,1
i ordered these for my husband he loves them the candy was fine but i had really hoped for the container as it was advertised he is a truck driver and makes good use of those containers ,1
nope do not let this picture baby tears plant pot helxine seduce you into buying it i got a plant whose growth was parallel to the rim of the planter perhaps of an inch in height definitely not healthily overflowing as in the picture but i will not return the plant and pay another in postage to get rid of it i ot burnt and i have learned and maybe you can learn from my mistake ,0
since moving to the us i thought my times for enjoying biltong were long gone well not so this chewy flavorsome delght is just about as good as it gets i would like to say the bags are too small but that would me being greedy if you have never had biltong before its a little different but after your third peice you will be ordering again enjoy p s as for the sausage did i like not so much ,1

first batch were great second batch reeked of bleach told amazon no return available so stuck with a bad box this one batch made me wonder how bad the quality control is for these green cow products decided not to take a chance again have never had these issues with the chunky chews brand ,0
ok i have used these bottles for years so i can not understand why some reviewers complain of them cracking they do if you drop them when they are full and heavy i wash mine in the dishwasher that is my only complaint the neck is narrow so i worry about it being completely clean btw i use bio kleen dishwashing detergent supposedly safer i always rinse again just in case the outer colored plastic on the side of the bottle does melt when heated but it does not leach into the inside because it is on the outside i placed it in the microwave not supposed to and that is why that plastic part melted i do not use the silicone nipples that come with them my little girls are picky they only like the soft tannish ones that i have to special order i no longer use these bottles though because i find the glass bottles same maker wash a lot cleaner in the dishwasher plus i can put them in the microwave w no worries my fears of the girls dropping the glass bottles are unfounded ,1
i purchased this product because the pods looked like they were made in a more earth friendly way there is no hard plastic cup involved we break down our cups after use we compost the coffee and recycle the foil tops the plastic cups end up in the garbage this product arrives in several heavy plastic bags for freshness the filter pods are synthetic so they can not be composted and the tops seem to be made of plastic not foil the only thing i can keep out of the garbage is the coffee itself the coffee tastes good ,0
such a unique flavor that is a hit at parties just throw it over whipped cream cheese and serve with crackers and you have the perfect appetizer ,1
my dog absolutely loves this food he has not had any problems with gas or itching like he had with other foods he will even eat it straight without any water on it the last food we tried he would not eat it without water on it it is a bummer that amazon does not have any more of this food in stock anymore hopefully that is not permanent ,1
delivered on time very tasty made waffles for breakfast and my family loved them also made waffles for dessert with ice cream and chocolate sauce wonderful ,1
this is a really good deal on cat nip here on amazon catnip is not something that is usually that expensive and a little of it goes a long ways but i have seen some difference in varieties and brands in the past of my worst being the more expensive organic stuff that did not work on getting my cats silly at all this cosmic brand i have had excellent results with it seems really strong and my two cats have a ball with it just sprinkle a little about one of their play toys outside or on a newspaper and watch your kitty roll around and get drunk on it i get best results with this and most catnip brands by exposing them to just a little bit of it and then waiting at least hours when the affect will be fresh on them but that is a real minimum i usually use this a couple of times a week to make it last and get maximum fun with it for me and my cats catnip is totally harmless to your cat they love it and you and your family will have a lot of fun watching your pet roll around and luxuriate in it this cosmic brand is a good deal for some really fresh catnip and i highly recommend it ,1
i bought a whole ham because the good review by an amazon reviewer on some other brand and because the amazon is descrition that it is an award winning ham the ham has excellent color aroma and taste on the salty side as expected for dry cured southern ham my wife and i are very pleased with it ,1
this is an excellent product but unfortunately its not eligible for super saver shipping so the cost is too much per tart,1
this is just like the ones that they sell in germany they are mighty tasty ,1
i love this product amazon did a great job of getting it to me in a prompt time ,1
my cat is a very picky eater this is the best price around and the best food too my cat goes gaga over it ,1
i have used and loved this product for years however they have changed the recipe it used to be pure date molasses but is now diluted and they have added sugar to it to make up for it it is not the same product and i now have jars that are unusable if you do not mind the sugar it might be fine but if you are looking for the pure date syrup this is not it anymmore ,0
love these bars i did not realize they would be so small though i guess i should have known from the oz description just wish they sold the larger ones otherwise awesome ,1
i loved these pods i was unsure about them but i took the plunge and it was the best move i made i would highly recomend these pods to anyone who likes good coffee ,1
this is my favorite soup and progesso makes it the best great for a cold winter supper with crackers or a roll ,1
a good way to start shopping for this product is to call enfamil to see their current pricing keeping in mind any differences in can size and number of cans in a case i have purchased this product through enfamil amazon and a few other places always taking advantage of the best deals i have purchased gentlease in every conceivable size and also case and continue to use it for my twins when they reach a year we plan to go to quit next the world health organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding until six months of age but here in the u s after your months maternity leave are you able to pump enough and store in a refrigerator at work and you might need formula anyway as we do i mention this because some imply their formula is as good as human breast milk we are blessed with twins they started out colicky and we found that nutramigen worked at that time they got through that phase and we have been using gentlease and solids after they are a year old it will be all solids our pediatrician recommended gentlease it has the lactose of milk based formula i really researched formulas there are even organizations promoting the sale of human breast milk and there are organizations wanting to stop the sale of human breast milk for fear of health hazards that the fda cannot control no matter those offering breast milk do so at prohibitively high prices nothing charitable about it all the brands that i have seen have dha and ara nutrients found in breast milk that promote brain and eye development iron which is necessary for growth and many more ingredients the government requires them to have certain ingredients the major brands do not seem highly differentiated to me except for their specialy models gentlease is one of those gentlease is one of the special formulas because it has a much lower amount of lactose as well as broken down proteins to make it easier to digest the prices vary and so do the size of the cans and the number of cans in a case unfortunately i have not seen gentlease in big cans at the big box stores one can also check at the local pharmacy or grocery store for comparison purposes keep an eye out for coupons too you have got to keep constant watch for the best price and there have been times when the amazon price prevails ,1
i do not know if i am doing it wrong or if the kefir grains i have are not any good i have had the milk grains for about weeks and i am following the directions exactly the grains are actually growing but every batch that i have made has that rotten sour milk taste any tips that anybody might have that could save this batch or do i just chuck these and start a new the water grains i got you are doing great ,0

i live in georgia where collard greens and fresh vegetables are eaten and loved by just about everyone i like trying new things and went to the local oriental market and purhcased this product i decided to put some on some collard greens and wow i could not believe how good it was on the greens and from then on i put them on just about all my cooked greens collards turnips and peas they are especially good on vegetables cooked with okra this chili paste just brought out the flavor of the vegetables and added some umph to them if you like spicy foods then you should try adding some of this chili paste to your vegetables you can adjust how spicy the vegetables by adding a little or a lot ,1
finally there is something i can eat that reminds me of being childlike and carefree lately i have been so pre occupied with reading ingredients i think i have forgotten how to enjoy food these are soooooo delicious and taste just like i remember ,1
i had to throw out three of the bottles of the batch that i ordered because they contained ground glass i noticed it instantly when i drank from the first bottle and the bits of glass hit my teeth i ran the rest through a filter and even more came out two more had the same problem now i do not know what to do with the rest of it i do not know if there was a problem in the manufacturing of the glass or they were not stored properly or if the inside of the bottles got chipped somehow but to have three of them in the same batch is highly suspicious ,0
we have cats one is and the other is we wanted a healthier food for our cats and dog so when i saw an ad in a magazine for this food i got online and researched it more there happened to be a coupon in the paper that week so i went to our pet store to buy some i must admit i was shocked at the price and almost did not buy it because even with a off coupon it is way more than i was used to spending i am so glad i did not back off and continue with our old brand i saw a huge difference in the cats in just a few days our year old cat who normally laid around all day and could not jump up on our fireplace mantel her favorite napping spot on the winter anymore was racing through the house and playing with our other cat she is now able to jump up on high places again hairballs have virtually disappeared and we very rarely have them throwing up anymore which was almost a daily occurance in our household i have tried a few of the other blue buffalo varieties and as long as they are chicken my cats love them sometimes i mix the blue wilderness with the blue regular for more nutrients my only complaint is i wish they had trial sizes because my cats normally hate any cat food with fish but i would love to see if they would eat the blue buffalo kind all in all if i could give this a star i would i know this a rating for the cat food but we are just as pleased with the dog food and as for the price you do not have to feed your animals as much because there are no fillers so for us the price evened out because i do not have to buy it as often ,1
as you know this noodle is one of korean traditional ramens very spicy but very yammy you can get this by using usps not ups so you can get this over,1
ocean spray is the best cranberry sauce i have tried it has just the right amount of sweetness yet still keeps the cranberry flavor not only is the product good but the packaging that this comes in is very convenient it comes in large plastic containers with a resealable top you do not have to struggle with opening a can and the sauce can still stay fresh the price of this also seems to have more bang for the buck if you love cranberry sauce and wish to buy in bulk this is the product for you ,1
i have always enjoyed peanut butter but always stayed away because of all the fat since i began using this product i look forward to having more each time tastes great i decide the consistency and the amount i want to make this product is incredible and since i also like chocolate this is the best of both worlds ,1
my kids love these suckers and i bought them to give away at a home show my company was involved in some people even came back to get another because they are so good ,1
i have been getting this cat food for my cat for the past year it is higher in protein than most popular brands which is important for her diet i would recommend it and i like the convenience of delivery and free shipping ,1
this is my first amazon review because i really liked how this wine turned out as with mostly all kits all needed items came with the kit juice f pack labels corks etc also all directions were easy to follow i did take the liberty and add an extra of disolved sugar into primary fermentor this wine would have given a abv of abotu without adding sugar with the sugar i was able to take it up to and the balance your relationship between flavor and alcohol content still really exists its been had by many people now all with outstanding surprise on their faces so for the price this kit is well worth the time and money enjoy ,1
i disagree with the previous review the mango and pineapple is better than all the other flavors i will continue buying it as long as it is available ,1
this gum is flavor lasted a total of about minute seriously the flavor is sweet and a little tangy it tastes good for the seconds that it lasts but honestly for minute what a piece of garbage will not be repurchasing ,0
is by far one of the greatest drinks out there easy to mix dissolves amazingly well very healthily and it tastes great each packet contains a nice of both fiber protein both of which us most people do not get enough of these days pink lemonade is the second best flavor unanimously between myself and of my friends ,1
my wife is picky about her coffee i myself can drink a variety of brands this coffee just suits us the best it is not bitter very smooth and you can not get a bad cup if you like strong coffee this will not be for you i do like a strong cup once in a while and i can not get this stuff strong enough it has flavor tho and we are happy with it the only thing that is not great about this coffee is the awful bag it just does not work so be prepared to store it other ways ,1
i bought this tea to help my pregnancy i think it may be helping im hoping but it does taste very good i like it and would buy it again and recommend this product to friends ,1
i bought these bottles because i liked that they were bpa free and they looked comfortable they are awful there is a lip inside the bottle that is a pain and makes it feel cheap and the real reason i hate this bottle all broke my son would drop it and it shattered each and every time today i lost the last bottle and i am going to be calling evenflo tomorrow to complain now do not take this as a slam against evenflo i have the glass bottles and the very cheap bpa free bottles and those are all great but the comfit really are not built to last even though they cost the most ,0
i ordered this at the beginning of august i wondered how they would deliver it without it melting and when it arrived melted with an ice pack tied to the chocolate bars i was not really surprised i refrigerated the package and the chocolate tasted fine cold but it definitely became a weird chalk like mess when it thawed i decided to heat it and use it to dip strawberries so good will order again in the dead of winter ,1
i love this tea and i am not really a tea person but this is a great drink and it is a very tasty treat ,1
i am very pleased with this dog food my sheltie has a good coat and good movements with harmony farms does much better with this food than others he is a very picky eater so i do add chicken and he will eat we will stick with harmony farms i also like the bag it helps keep the food fresh ,1
this product truly exceeded my expectations i entertained at our home recently and served a cocktail made with tanqueray about ounces a bottle of this and the juice of half a lime for each drink it was really really good especially on a hot day the drink is essentially a gin rickey with bitter lemon instead of soda water if you like gin with citrus you will love this drink again this is a great product ,1
guys although i was a bit skeptical at first i got to say these are pretty neat because you can fill it with your own coffee and it is also a one time use cartridge for about a pop if you go to coffee cap shop one word and select the cheapest shipping capsules at plus shipping nespresso has a very tight grip on the distribution of their capsules but a slight design change in these allows them to work with the nespresso machines while still not infringing on their copyright note there are alternatives to this product which are re usable called nex pod and another referred to only as brown or black or coffeeduck after experimenting a bit i noticed that if you want the richer coffee and thick crema you should stick with a darker roasted robusta beans finely ground espresso or fine grind check out,1
i have been hooked on hawaiian natural teas since receiving a gift basket last year now i just do not want to drink any other tea there is a variety of flavors all infused with delicious fruit that does not overwhelm the taste of the tea love the aroma as it steeps the mango peach is one of my favorites the scent almost like a bite of fresh fruit it is that good ,1
my cats love this flavor and brand of cat food all natural without gross fillers extras and puffed corn or wheat like other brands you find in stores ,1
this mix of drink mixes is a good starter kit to figure out what you like i was not sure what i was looking for and it was a good mix for my wife and i i prefer the darker stuff and she likes the lighter stuff we both found what we like it here plus it comes with some iced t and hot chocolate ,1
the lamb is tender and spiced like a true vindaloo which is quite spicy strange thing i discovered if i eat the food warm and not piping hot then the spice level is medium to hot if you heat it according to instructions then you will get a habanero like hotness there are about chunks of lamb in each meal perhaps ounces worth so it is more of a lunch sized portion at under calories it is delicious and i have not had any better at indian restaurants ,1
i liked this coffee so well that i ordered it again the only thing disappointing to me was that the first order was packed in pack tully boxes whereas the second order was just all thrown together in a cardboard mailing box ,1
this is the best decaf coffee anywhere you can not even tell it is decaf i would recommend it to everyone well worth the extra money ,1
i drink this every afternoon with two heaping teaspoons in ounces of water this does not make me either sleepy nor calm however it is both a good way to hydrate the stuff tastes good and get a daily dose of magnesium so i like it and will purchase it again i am writing this a month or two later and this in fact does calm me and it also promotes a good night is sleep i just ordered my second canister ,1
this stuff is amazing like really though i actually think i might like it more than the regular stuff like no joke ,1
ok let is cover what this is not this is not a macaroni and cheese dish this is a wonderful buttered noodle side dish with a hint of cheese a sniff of bacon so if you are wanting mac cheese take a pass but if you are looking for a wonderful side for a beef dish perfection ,1
it is pretty unbelievable that people use this stuff in lieu of chemical artificial sweeteners because it is good for you yet turns your bowels to water some say that you even have to get your body accustomed to the intake of this stuff use your heads people if this has such an adverse effect on your digestive system that you must condition your body to these bad effects then exactly how good for you is this stuff luckily i had the chance to try this before buying a lot of it if your idea of fun is being able to sh t through a screen door at paces and never leaving a stain then go for it but please refrain from telling me how good this stuff is for you ,0
to begin with i am no expert in the field and i have pretty limited range of experience that being said i love glenmorangie original it has wonderful aroma and complex flavors i do not know all the proper lingo i am afraid but it has sweetness and smokiness and a little citrus maybe it is light and not peaty the finish is long and lovely when you roll this whiskey around your mouth a bit the mouth feel is very rich and pleasant this is a far more complex drink than american or canadian whiskeys and a bit richer than glenlivet the scotch i met first ,1
looking for gluten free oats that are will not break your grocery budget is difficult but after having celiac diseae for twelve years i am grateful for the farmers who are taking such drastic measures to create a gluten free oat everything has to be accounted for each field has to be clean of other grain each machine used has to be used only for gf oats it is a daunting task to take on so thank you legacy valley and the other few hard working producers i would have given five stars except these oats tend to come with too many husks and unrolled oats in the bag if you do not carefully sift through them before cooking you will be pulling the hard husks and unrolled oat pieces out of your cookies or oatmeal bowl my kids did not care for that and we found bob is red mill gluten free oats never contain these unappetizing little bits i am not affiliated with bob is red mill just giving an honest review as a long time celiac and mom to two celiac children ,1
i bought this for my dogs after finding beef lung treats at costco my dogs love them i should have read the details better for this product i looked at the picture and thought it said lbs it is only oz though for i got a lb bag of beef lung at costco this oz container is worth maybe a dollar or two not a good value ,0
i love the coffee pods and i love the fact that amazon sells them in bulk thanks ,1
i recently went to japan and although i could not find the same kind of chocolate bars i could get in the states i was thrilled to try this brand i have not had a full bar only the pack of mini bars and they do not disappoint they are pack individually in gold foil and come in a easy to dispense box i would love to be able to get the mini bar packs somewhere online any ideas ,1
i love these bags because i can finally compost kitchen scraps without a big mess but the gallon size is a lot smaller than a polyethelene plastic bag of the same size it doesnt fit into my gallon trash can not even close i would say the gallon bags are more like gallon bags perfect for a gallon bucket ,1
these taste amazing i use them in a taco salad or just plain out of the bag they have just enough of a kick and the fact that of the profits of this company goes to sending kids to camps is just great way to go late july ,1
artic zero is a great substitute for those on a diet tastes good and you can over indulge in the whole pint without feeling guilty although you can purchase this at most whole foods for a pint ,1
first off i usually do not drink my coffee straight black secondly the hotel had a cafexpress dual pod brewer in my room to make the perfect cup s of coffee i am not a coffee drink usually however i have recently taken up the habit this coffee is the second best coffee i have ever tasted next to panera is when i got home i immediately got online and ordered this coffee from the wolfgangpuck com website i make this coffee in a black and decker dual personal coffeemaker black and stainless this coffeemaker has two black and stainless steel travel mugs i buy the coffee in the pod form and it tastes just fine ,1
my kids and years old love these they make a great snack because they are not full of refined sugar but still taste sweet ,1
heally bovine disease free product just the right size not to get all skanky great outlet for your pet ,1
ok i was a little reluctant to buy this because of some of the negative reviews but the fact is that for the purpose i needed it for it worked extremely well i had a squirrel infestation under the eaves and eventually in the walls of my house i tried many things including bounce fabric softener live traps and soiled kitty litter nothing worked they just gnawed away at my walls when i used the critter ridder they were gone by the end of the day and have not been back since yes it is a little pricey but for the effectiveness and damage prevention it is well worth the price i can not speak to other pests but this stuff works on squirrels one note of caution i was a little careless when applying the spray to some lovers in the attic and inhaled the merest wisp of over spray i thought i was going to drop dead on the spot but the effects wore off after not too much time use care when applying ,1
i received a tin of this rishi organic earl grey loose tea as a gift a year ago i have enjoyed it immensely having lived abroad i have become accustomed to brewing loose tea as well as using tea bags i love this tea so much that i only brewed it once in a while as a special treat so as not to use it up all at once i wish it was decaffeinated but other than that it is truly enjoyable because i like a weaker tea i only use maybe less than a teaspoon per pot the aroma is great also the fact that this tea is organic is a bonus ,1
this stuff is amazing my friend and i found it at a little coffee shop in san diego and thought it was going to be out of our lives forever after we left but no found it on here amazing worth a shot ,1

after looking everywhere for this yummy custard and not being able to find it in the stores i was pleasantly surprised to find it here we have been eating custard frequently now and the kids love it i would suggest the stove method because the microwave method while it saves time just does not taste as good so glad to find it and have it shipped so quickly i would recommend this product and seller for sure ,1
this stuff is really yummy and only calories for the whole ounces definitely recommend it if you do any type of work out that dehydrates you it is not super sweet so it is still refreshing when you are really thirsty love this coconut water,1
compared to other fussie premium cat foods we tried this seems to have less in the can we had them in different occasions and cans do not have as much food so our cats feel hungry very soon ,0
we started using this product after we learned that organic similac contained sugar and was in the process of being banned in the eu i believe that this product uses lactose as the sugar needed to break down the milk based protein we knew that we wanted an organic milk based product to supplement breast feeding when necessary and this one seemed to have the best ingredients so far our babies seem to tolerate it quite well no excessive gas or allergies that we can tell after about weeks of using this brand also the color is more like my milk and it does not stain or have an off putting smell like other formulas we have seen ,1
i love both almonds and chocolate and they make a great snack together but often can be quite the mess emerald is cocoa roasted almonds dark chocolate are an excellent solution to this one drawback the chocoalte does not make your hands a mess and you stil get the great taste one warning perhaps is that this resembles cocoa powder than the form of chocolate one normally gets in a candy bar or in chocolate coated nuts it has less of the sweetness than that and more of a bite perhaps an acquired taste it is none the less excellent and a real treat ,1
love these they are a favorite to have around the holidays and they make a great stocking stuffer will definitely order again ,1
i went to a japanese resturant weeks ago and had a cup of this tea every other cup of green tea i have had since then does not come close if you like green tea try this one you will not be disappointed ,1
it is not just your regular garlic salt there must be other spices in there that really bring out the flavor adds a little garlic flavor to just about anything great for quick garlic bread add to sour cream for garlic dip sprinkle on popcorn in scrambled eggs mashed potatoes salad etc i like it because i can add the garlic flavor to my portion of food on my own plate too when cooking for others who do not like garlic ,1
i usually have coffee first thing in the morning for that wake up burst click does it better tastes great and has that caffeine jolt this will be my morning drink of choice ,1

this shampoo is a cream shampoo that claims to nourish the scalp but the second ingredient sodium laurel sulfate is a known scalp irritant the shampoo is also tinted pink as is the matching conditioner i do not like using hair products with dyes because they stain my hair it is also heavily scented i will not use it again and i would not recommend it for anyone else ,0
over the years our dogs have put on weight dog food reviews online rates this kibble their highest rating you can smell the salmon in it so our dogs come running when you open the bag and eagerly await filling their bowls i can feed them less as it is more filling they have all lost a few pounds i have had no problems with switching them to it either i highly recommend ,1
i have been eating these since i first tried them on a commercial air line flight at least years ago i was thrilled that amazon still sold them since all the b m is have stopped selling them but unfortunatly all great things must come to an end i will not pay plus for cans i made it through the burnt peanut problem and love amazon is service but at these new prices i will have to just say no it is a shame that such a great product is not sold by local stores any more and that planters does not push this product harder ,1
worst tasting peanut brittle ever if it even earns the rating to be classified as peanut brittle it simply just does not taste the way good peanut brittle should taste at first glance it looks good in appearance but do not let that fool you it tastes absolutely awful of plastic preservatives with peanuts ,0
this is the best tonic water available anywhere it is actually lower in calories than those touted as diet get this if you love gin and tonics ,1
this is a good pepper medley and a great value it is hard to pour into my grinder but we make do ,1
my husband and i had purchased this product at our local whole foods before so we knew we liked it we have tried just about every kind of protein you can imagine whey makes you bloated pea tastes like chalk egg makes you pooty goat you do not want to know so anyway the nutiva hemp protein has grams of protein and grams of fiber per serving t is awesome and does not make our morning smoothies taste funky yum we ordered this while we were out of town for the weekend and the hemp beat us home great product great service would highly recommend it to anyone ,1
feed dogs bones and raw food diet but also give kibble a sprinkling of this on top of the kibble is popular with our dogs expensive so i only use a small amount ,1
this is a great value for people who enjoy seaweed it has a great spicy flavor but the taste of the seaweed is not lost just be aware packets is a lot of seaweed each strip is inches long ,1
i am disappointed in that i cannot really taste the hazelnut flavor the coffee is also light ,0
i have always preferred the boxed velveeta with shells over kraft macaroni and cheese or is it cheese and macaroni it is cheesier and more flavorful to now compete with hamburger helper velveeta came out with their new cheesy skillets meal in a box i tried the ultimate cheeseburger mac version unfortunately i did not have any hamburger on hand so i used what i did have kielbasa i also added some roasted peppers the pasta in velveeta cheesy skillets is a much larger version of elbow macaroni it really holds and absorbs the sauce well in addition to the tradition soft cheese sauce like the velveeta shells boxes come with there is a seasoning packet to add to the meat pasta and water it really added a lot of flavor to the already rich creamy cheese sauce it feels a step above hamburger helper much like their boxed shells is a step above traditional boxed macaroni and cheese my only disappointment there was literally only a handful of pasta included in the big box and the package says that it contains five servings five seriously who are they kidding if i split the box up into five servings everyone would literally get half a cupful these are supposed to be entire meals in one not side dishes let is be realistic here my suggestion buy the box and an additional box of pasta add additional water when cooking and you will make a real dinner for five there is plenty of seasoning and sauce to cover and flavor any added pasta ,1
i tried it a few times first to just try then again to compare against nespresso capriccio green pod which has an intensity of and is made like the ecc is expressivo arabica and robusto mix the nespresso capriccio is not my favorite because it is relatively weak then i tasted the expressivo i was amazed how much weaker an espresso can get and to legally call it espresso folger is makes much better coffee and i think folger is is boring i like the environmental friendliness of this company but it has to make a better tasting product this stuff was horrible i still have pods to drink i guess i will give it away to my environmentalist friends as a gift so disappointed ,0
from start to finish no problems item arrived as requested one day early my dog is healthier because he has been on sd since a pup ,1
it really works and clean up is much easier than using a spoon the lid did not fit our store brand plastic jar too big but it was still a better option ,1
love the product the wife gives me one every night if i am a good boy if not i go to bed with plaque ,1
these bars are delicious love having them on hand for my afternoon snack the taste combo is a wonderful balance and the texture is fine ,1
teeccino is a wonderful caffeine free alternative to coffee after giving up coffee because it was keeping me up at night i switched to decaf but decaf was bitter and still contained a small amount of caffeine i read about teeccino and then ordered the tee bags although you can buy the ground variety and brew it like coffee i chose the tee bags so that i could take them with me to restaurants the taste is much bolder and richer than tea and you can smell the dates figs and herbs wafting up from your cup i do not miss coffee in the morning anymore i ordered the teeccino sampler to taste all the different flavors available and hazelnut is one of my favorites ,1
the treats are great my overly sensitive dog love these and they have no upset his stomach no corn no wheat no by products whats not to love being small they go a long way and its easy not to over feed them highly recommended ,1
tastes fresh a little tangy with great granny smith apple notes cannot even taste a hint of artificial sweetener all flavor is apples tangy lemon and the like would definitely buy ,1
i can not believe i am going to write this review but these are the only type of artichoke hearts i will use i have this wonderful recipe for artichoke soup we have tried to make this recipe using other artichokes that have other name brands on them these are the ones that we find make the best soup for our tastes ,1
this chipotle powder has heat mostly when you either microwave it or use it while your cooking it goes great sprinkled on cooked quinoa and vegetables i cook with no fat and oils so this is a good way to add flavor i am going to buy some paprika and mix it in a separate jar chipotle and paprika and see how that comes out i might add some other seasonings but dont know what i will use yet i have made it with tuna steaks and salmon and chicken so far needs to be added with other items but i think if i made a liquid sauce using this powder i will be able to create a more flavorful dish so all in all for the price its a great deal but the shipping is kinda steep for a light item maybe buying more than one item saves money i am not sure but i will make another review after i try all these things and see what goes better with this itemp s amazons super saver free shipping is cool cause its free but it takes so looooooooooooooooooooooong to get your stuff oh well at least its free lol,1
this is my favorite flavor of the sensible foods fruit snacks they are gluten free which is necessary for me with celiac disease i love this flavor and like to sprinkle them on yogurt for breakfast in the morning when berries are out of season and so expensive i wish the pieces were bigger to make it easier to just eat by themselves as a snack my daughter is diabetic and also loves this line of snacks ,1
finally i was able to purchase good seasons cesar dressing the grocery stores here do not carry it anymore imagine my surprise that i was able to buy the dressing through amazon the price is great and free shipping mix with oil and vinegar and you have got the best dressing around ,1
that irresistible dickensian odor as it warms british culinary experience is not world noted from london is bangers and mash to liverpool is scouse to glasgow is haggis this isle of bad teeth is not normally sought for its kitchen fare and so within this small can it comes to us in dickens we read of the ravenous appetites consuming the most bizarre items of tiny tim is bag of lard boiled with brandy and a plum of whatever it was fagin gave his small boys in london is slums here we share a taste of those delights do not let this discourage you let a can of this sit opened in a pan of bubbling hot water alongside a can of evaporated milk this in itself makes an adequate holiday pot pourri filling your house with cozy warmth and this is undoubtedly the only safe manner to consume it olfactory rather than gustatory considering the transfats sugars and flour remember my child the warm mothering spirit of adele davis she of best thing since indian pudding ,0
i have ordered this several times i use it in baking cooking and have even learned to make my own lotion using this product thanks for a great product ,1

clean fresh tasting olive oils picual has a little kick to it which the year old connoisseur in my house particularly enjoyed for info she also is partial to only year old parmigiano reggiano i personally like the single origin of the olives and the pure taste it is also a bonus knowing that chile is one of the least polluted places on earth great for gifts or a healthy splurge for your own kitchen fast delivery worth every penny ,1
our cabinets are filled with every salt free seasoning there is we rely heavily on mrs dash and really love it however i saw this listed on amazon com and it was the first time i had ever seen it based on good reviews i not only purchased it for my house but sent a package to family members with heart issues now that we have all used it the reviews are in all of them great so far we have used cavender is on chicken cutlets whole roast chicken talapia and cold pasta salad with chopped vegetables we love it and will make it a definite part of our spice rotation if you are looking for something new to zest up the flavor of salt free food cavender is all purpose greek seasoning is really quite good ,1
as long as i am able to eat these in moderation and not eat a box a day i really like this dark mocha almond kind it is delicious however i am the type of person who likes rice cakes as someone mentioned in a previous review that only someone who likes rice cakes would like these and it is a good price on amazon especially compared to the dollar a bar prices at a lot of these new york city grocery stores just got it in the mail and already on my second bar ,1
okay i do not know what the magic ingredient is in this but my cat is absolutely in love with it he is one picky eater i have tried literally all the healthy types of treats greenies etc i can find in the stores but he is either lukewarm about them or just refuses to eat them alas i am wary about stuff from friskies since i was told that they are unhealthy i read the ingredients list and it did not say chicken by product so i guess it is better than the average friskies anyway i have given up on healthy treats i mix greenies in his regular food now because i know they do not work as treats i guess i will just have to make sure i do not overfeed him with these treats because he is addicted my cat is not a lap cat but he will actually deign to come and sit on my lap when he wants these treats ,1
we adopted our cat from animal control and she was a scrawny little thing of course after our love and affection she because a very cute very fat thing we decided to put her on a diet and this cat food has been a lifesaver our cat loves the taste she has lost weight and is not hungry between meals absolutely love this stuff and we order it all the time ,1
great suace for any indonesian dish asian foods over rice etc texture is more syrupy than soy sauce and sweeter ,1
we have been getting these biobags for quite a while as small trash can liners in the beginning they were not very sturdy and came in a roll when we tore them apart even if we were careful sometimes at least one of the two bags we were trying to separate would tear to the point that it could not be used now the bags are much stronger and come separated i have not used biobags for compost since they have been stronger so i do not know if they still break down as fast as they did but in the past i have used them in compost and seen them break down more quickly than some foods it is a good idea to change the bag relatively frequently if you are using it for anything very moist another note messes involving vomit should not be placed into biobags because apparently the stomach acid cuts right through them resulting in an even worse mess i really love these bags and the improvements to them over time ,1
i was very disappointed in the taste of these cookies they seemed dry and did not taste as yummy as i thought they should ,0

i love goya tomato sauce and its not sold in my town amazon had it cheaper than i normally pay plus the added bonus of not having to drive minutes and pay taxes on it the only downside would be the mail carrier more than half the cans arrived dented amazon was nice enough to refund some of the cost ,1
c e t hextra premium oral hygiene chews with chlorhexindine medium dogs was recommended by our vet because our dog was beginning to have some tarter on her teeth he sold us a small package the dog loved them we were able to get a package twice as big from amazon for only a couple of dollars more our dog still loves the chews her teeth look very clean we have recommended the chews to two other dog owners and their dogs have been as happy with the chews as our dog i would much prefer to purchase the chews than have the dog put to sleep to have her teeth cleaned ,1

it is litter cat is will use it but really are you sure you want them no odor creates an ungodly odor when mixed with cat urine i would go so far as to say it is vomit it sticks to the bottom of the box so that you are going at it at every angle to scoop it off the bottom i have some sturdy scoops they have held but but we have worked at it together to clean that gooey sticky too light that it just flies across the room tracking it everywhere in the houseyes it is environmentally friendly as we were trying to transition to this and we have used it for about months now we recently purchased clay litter again we have boxes in our house yes insane i know in the unfinished basement and two on our main level there are out of boxes with clay they are the only boxes the cats are using i agree with them once the litter is used it is gone ,0

recently i had the pleasure of trying the kiwi berry flavor of switch fruit juice it is unbelievable that a sugarless carbonated drink can taste so great and yet be good for you the kiwi berry was bold and tangy instead of sweet and cloying the carbonation made the drink sparkling and energetic since i have recently kicked my year habit of drinking diet coke i have been looking for a substitute drink that was not straight fruit juice or straight soda as an american i have become accustomed to thinking that carbonated drinks are the fun ones and that merely being healthy by drinking juice is boring so switch allows me to feel healthy and have some fun at the same time while also giving up caffeine which i really do not want during the day if switch comes out with additional flavors i will certainly try those as well ,1
almost every order was delivered with some of the cans dented this last order actually had a can damaged so badly that it was open we did not initially observe the broken can after about a week in our pantry the smell was unbearable we inspected numerous items from the pantry before determining that the smell was coming from the mighty dog worms were observed in one open can we got rid of the offending can and about others that had fluid from the broken can we immediately cancelled any future orders ,0

i purchased this product supplied by as seen on tv ws in december when i tried the product for the first time it never worked i contacted the seller as seen on tv ws and told them that the product was defective i was told they would ship a newer revised unit once they became available however when this one came it was still the old style i had the same experience as with the first one it did not work after contacting the company again i was asked to return both units at my expense and they would send the newer style that was now available now i have been told that they will not send another product since shipping to canada would be to costly but instead refund my original purchase price without compensating my expense of returning two defective products so how do i rate this products i can not it never worked to begin with how do i rate the seller you draw your own conclusion ,0

some of my favorite mother is recipes call for caramel as a kid i remember unwrapping them and stealing a few as my mom would be baking i love making many of these recipes today and have found it difficult to get my hands on kraft caramels it is bizarre that they have become a rarity in our area because they are definitely the best on the market to eat as is and use in cooking they melt nice and creamy but they also harden back to a perfect consistency when cooled i was very excited to find them on amazon and for such a great price i am sure over time i will end up using all bags that is if i do not end up sharing my fortune with friends d i definitely recommend this product to all great cooks and sweet caramel tooth out there ,1

my adult daughter is review love the fact that it is organic and it actually tastes pretty good i taste tested it for the little one i usually make my own baby food for the first year but with three kids and no time i thought i would try the baby gourmet organic baby food the easy squeeze packaging is nice though i kind of like to reuse baby food jars for sewing supplies and nails and screws etc my main complaint is the mixtures they come in i wish that the stage foods were single fruits or vegetables not a mix of three like this pear spinach broccoli combo pediatritions always say to introduce just one new food at a time when your baby is in stage and to check for reactions for three days before introducing another these multi food meals make it impossible to do that for stage and later it would be fine but mixes are a pain at the mark ,1
first of all i must admit that i was a bit mistaken as to the product i kept seeing the words peach tea and thought i was buying some sort of tea there is no tea about this product this is a water enhancer basically something to flavor your water so that you ostensibly will want to drink more of it more disappointing when you check the ingredients there is no peach listed anywhere instead you get a laundry list of chemicals and dyes that taste like are you ready chemicals and dyes i will take plain old water over this any time ,0
i wanted this product to be great i yearned for this product to be great it turned out to be fair if you use the recommended serving size you will find you do not taste is at all nada zip if you use three times the recommended serving you will find it subtly makes your popcorn taste like cheddar and i do mean subtle you will have to hunt for the flavor do not expect cheesy popcorn because you will not get it with this seasoning it does not cling to the popcorn very well either which further diminishes the flavor you will need to prep the popcorn by popping in oil or by pouring butter on after you air pop the popcorn oh well the search to make air popped popcorn tasty goes on because this product ai not it that said the flavor is pretty good but as previously mentioned i can not taste it unless i use way more than the recommended serving size which then defeats the low calorie benefit too bad ,0
if you have ever had the real deal you will know this is not it after having had the trader joe is brand and the giradhelli sp brand this stuff does not even compare very artificial tasting do not buy especially if you are using it in a recipe suck it up and pay more for the top brand stuff or make your own it is worth it ,0

this is the best of hormel is pasta line of compleats meals the sauce is very tasty the tiny bits of beef do not surprise you with bone or grizzle and the spaghetti is not particularly mushy i find most of their other forms of pasta to be highly overcooked and starchy and even among their other spaghetti dishes the sauce in this one tastes the best the day they make this with whole wheat pasta instead of unhealthy white i will raise my rating to stars ,1
this is a quality dog food it is high in protein and has a variety of ingredients none of which caused me to say what in the world is that unfortunately for me though it turns out that my puppy has sensitivity to gluten and barley is the ingredient listed for this food i would recommend this food for someone who wants a high quality food for their puppy but does not need grain free if your dog gets incredibly gassy and has strong smelling soft poop or loose stools when eating this i would suggest switching to completely gluten free dog food ,1
trying to snack well is important to me as one way of maintaining some degree of good health one tactic that i am trying to adopt is sensible snacking at the place where i work i sometimes have broccoli carrots and celery with a dip at other times i have sliced apples and eat them plain i also use this trail mix a combination of nuts peanuts and cashews and fruit raisins banana chips pineapple and cranberries the combination is crunchy and tasty i try to make one package stretch across three days rather than eating all at once but these are tasty critters thus a successful snack for me ,1

i love having ginger ale to drink especially when my stomach is not feeling well so i tried to purchase this and see how i would like it it was nothing like i imagined it to taste like it has a real taste to the actual ginger root and i was highly disappointed because it was nothing like what i expected especially with all the positive reviews so buyer beware that this product has that ginger root taste to it and now i am stuck with the bulk that i purchased so i will look into giving it away to friends who may enjoy it i got this sadly comment back from some bored person nowhereman says six of your eight reviews are one star perhaps it is merely poor judgment in purchasing decision making maybe you need to see someone for postpartum depression any attempt at defensive rebuttal might help provide insight into the psychological origins of this hostility and help a professional to diagnose if you need education or treatment run do not walk to caregivers they can help you sort it out as i am uniquely unqualified to pinpoint the exact nature of the problem it would not hurt to take english as a second language in either case my take on your reply to my review too bad if you do not like what you read you are free to move on i do not post reviews for entertainment purposes as you seem to be evaluating and insulting comments posted before you judge someone from a petty post of review please keep in mind it does not give you the person is lifestyle nor psychological origins i work in the medical field so if anyone needs help that is for you to seek i also have two special needs children so please education does run deep in this household keep your comments to yourself sadly after what you have posted it is obvious you are in need of some jesus and the love you lack in life god bless ,0
the brand sold at whole foods we go through this like it is candy i have ordered some brands that were hard or dried out or not fermented the right way but this is perfectly tender and sweet like it is supposed to be with that hint of garlic savory so i do not care what you put it on it is great we learned about black garlic for health reasons anti inflammatory and the passion began from there because it just replaces any spice anytime i do not know how i want to add zing to food i top it with black garlic for rave reviews and it looks pretty too great on lasagna or in spring rolls for example very versatile ,1

after a lot of research i decided to switch my old doberman from iams to canidae and have been very impressed with the product samson loves this stuff too with the iams i had to entice him to eat by mixing it with canned food tablefood but with the canidae he eagerly wolfs it down by itself and why not the first ingredients are all meats human grade at that besides having less filler canidae uses no corn products which is good for dogs with allergies corn is a common allergen in dogs some may balk at the price but you are going to use less food per day then with the junk brands due to the high quality of indredients in this stuff besides canidae is considerably cheaper then most of the other top shelf brands like eagle pack or flint river i am just happy to be able to feed my dog a super premium grade food knowing how much healthier this is for him for just a few bucks more per bag then a mid grade food like iams or pro plan when you look at it like that i believe it is one of the best values in pet nutrition on the market today ,1

ok i have read a lot of people complain about this product not knowing what the heck they are talking about i have the truth with proof about this particular brand of canned tomato first off if you know how strict the laws are about wine in france then the same applies with italians and their tomatoes if they are not dop certified and grown in san marzano sul sarno italy then by law they are not allowed to be called san marzano tomatoes which now brings me to this product yes the brand name is actually san marzano however they are not grown nor imported in from italy but and it is a huge but they are actually san marzano tomatoes how can this be you ask well they are grown from san marzano tomato seeds ahh haaa they are locally grown in the us in the same conditions as san marzano sul sarno italy with san marzano tomato seeds probably the closest thing you will find to the real thing without the cost i found a website that backs up my info and also rates every kind of canned san marzano tomato here is an excerpt of this brand this domestic san marzano product has been cultivated in the usa using the same variety of seed used in san marzano italy which produces a tomato that is deep red firm and meaty and with very few seeds if you want to find the website i am talking about do a search for san marzano tomatoes brands companies and click on the first link sorry amazon will not let me link to them directly you might learn something about this great product there you have it they never lied they did not mislead they are true to there brand literally ha you are welcome ,1

first let me be clear i do not work for this company or have any kind of connection to them i am just a mom whose kid likes them these snacks are intended for toddlers or preschoolers not for the more mature sugar numbed palate of an older grade school aged child or an adult ever try baby food it is pretty bland these are not bland but they are probably not going to be the cookie treat to have with tea for an adult they do actually taste like peanut butter and jelly just maybe not the goober brand of candy sweet pb j that comes combined in the same jar or the creamy sugar packed jiff pb and smucker is grape jelly you may glob onto white sandwich bread this is a healthy snack and my two year old loves them she would eat the whole box as i think most toddlers preschoolers would if given the chance as for the one reviewer is bug report this may come as a shock but these are made with fruit and fruit sometimes has bugs on around in it not saying i would not be thoroughly grossed out myself but stuff happens and maybe one got by them i have never had that experience in the year we have been giving these to our daughter sometimes you find a piece of bone in your hamburger or you get a seed in your seedless watermelon it just happens it does not mean you never eat those foods again these snacks are organic they are made with healthful ingredients and they save the day when your child will not eat enough or any of the dinner you made or when they are sick and super picky about what they want to eat or when they are hungry and the next meal is still an hour or more away do not pass these up grab a single box of them at bru and see if your toddler likes them after all that is what matters ,1

this assortment was awful i received of the same flavor of holiday flavors i ordered after the holidays as well of of other flavors this picture shows different varieties but i only received a few different flavors also these were shipped in a brown paper bag which caused many of the cups to be damaged i am very very disappointed with this order i will never purchase anything from deals on call llc through amazon it is a shame amazon does not monitor its vendors more closely ,0

love these cookies they taste great i was looking for a natural and organic snack and these back to nature chocolate chip cookies are just what i needed the only issue i have is the amount of calories calories for cookies but the cookies are a good size if you eat cookies like i do somtimes its still not that bad calorie wise cals buying them in bulk from amazon really helps somtimes there is a little breakage but for the most part the cookies arrive intact and ready to eat dollar for dollar its the best deal you are going to find i say buy them and stop eating all those artificial chocolate chip cookies loaded with junk lets eat healthy america ,1
i do not normally work with fondant because it tastes terrible this is no exception it is not as awful as wiltons you can actually eat it without gagging but that is probably because it has tons of artificial flavor and huge amounts of sugar but the color is amazing and it rolls out nicely i used this with the red for a cat in the hat cake and it came out wonderfully it is perfect to add fun pops of color to kids cakes etc ,1
i would probably give this product a star rating if half stars were allowed here the good the taste i honestly did not expect to like this as much as i do but i think the balance of cocoa and cinnamon is just right the cocoa in particular tastes very good i am assuming a high quality cocoa is used in this product since it tastes much better than the mass market cocoa you would likely find at your local grocery store the texture this granola comes with lots of fairly large clumps not just a bunch of small pieces it is definitely possible to eat this dry right out of the bag the almonds and whole grain oats contribute to a nice crunchy texture the not so good the nutritional information if you are very good about controlling your intake this could certainly be a fine addition as a snack i however have a hard time not overconsuming sweet foods and this granola is definitely sweet as most granolas are just one serving of this granola packs calories with of those being from fat and almost another from carbohydrates nearly half of those being listed as sugars if you are doing your math then you already know that that means this product provides very little protein in fact only grams per serving and here is the kicker all of that nutritional information is based on a serving size of only cup or ounces of this product each bag supposedly contains close to servings i honestly think it would be far more reasonable to double the values above and double the serving size as i have a hard time imagining that most people would only eat cup of this product at a time ,1
nutri source catfood was recommended to me by my pet groomer i have cats half were having a problem with loose bowels this food has an enzyme on it that helps with that problem the cats love it they eat less because they have fewer bowel movements less is wasted and in the litter boxes it is also for kittens and adults which is beneficial when you have a range of ages ,1

i got exaclty what i asked for and very fast too i have used pamela is products before but it was much more expensive buying it from the health food store buying it in bulk is a better way on my wallet plus if i am in the middle of baking and realize im low there is another bag in the cabinet the gluten free mixes are so easy to use and there are so many more recipies on the website,1

organic india tulsi tea is to me the absolute best tea i have ever had both in terms of taste and effects i have tried several types and have found that i enjoy chai masala and india breakfast the most i enjoy them separately but also bag of india breakfast and of bag of chai masala makes a perfect iced chai black tea will give most anyone an energy boost but tulsi tea is unique to me in that it truly does as the manufacturers claim leave one feeling both energized and relaxed perhaps centered or focused would be the best word tack onto that the purported health benefits of tulsi and you have got yourself one fantastic tea there are a number of non tulsi teas i enjoy but organic india is tulsi tea is the only tea i purchase on a consistent basis and that i always have on hand also it is the one type of tea i am frequently recommending to friends and family give it a try ,1
i have tried the peppered spicy and original there is a lot of inconsistency between packages the last batch i bought was the original flavor and it has a very chewy unpleasant texture no flavor unpleasant aftertaste the smell is awful it smells like a dog treat some pieces have a bunch of gristle attached the only redeeming quality is that the jerky is not loaded with msg but i just can not stomach the stuff anymore ,0
i added this to my cart so i could reach the free shipping limit the tea is weak there is no orange taste to it the tea bags are in individually wrapped large plastic envelopes too much packaging ,0
this product beats most processed cat foods it has plenty of flakes and the smell is strong enough to attract and kick off your cat is apetite they have just the right amount of juice water and its consistency is hardy enough to be more than just an appetizer my cat loves this food i have switched entirely to this food i prefer it over other cup or canned foods because i can see the actual fish flakes and not just some blended mess it still has some preservatives but they are minimal compared to other foods if you susbscribe to amazon is delivery subscribe save you can save a lot of money compared to your local store is price or a one time only purchase here at amazon all in all a great product cats love it they do not get sick and seem happier overall they can not have enough of this note warning this product is made in thailand not the u s a ,1

i had been wanting to try steel cut oats for about a year then i saw these at a local health food store i absolutely had to buy this stuff i love this oatmeal it is not slimy and mushy like rolled oats it has quite a nice texture to it closer to brown rice than rolled oats i always have mine with a pat of butter and a tablespoon or two of honey sometimes i use brown sugar but i think the honey is better while it is much better cooked on the stove i have determined a way of cooking it in what i think is an or watt microwave the microwave is not labeled with its wattage and the packaging and owner is manual are long gone combine cup oats and cup water in a dish that holds at least four cups microwave minutes or until boiling let stand for minutes continue microwaving for to minute intervals letting stand at least two minutes between until done to desired firmness watch carefully to make sure it does not boil over i do this in my cup pyrex measuring cup and stop the microwave as soon as the boiling water and oats come within an inch of the top ,1
i love this coconut oil i use it on my body face and hair it also smells and tastes delicious i can eat it plain but one of my favorite ways to eat it is with some mini chocolate chips sprinkled over a spoonful of it yum i also like to cook french toast in it and top my sweet potatoes with it my only complaint is that it is a little grainy i do not notice it so much when i eat it but i do when i am using it as a moisturizer it is not that big of a deal though and to be fair this is the only coconut oil i have ever bought so i can not compare it to any other brands i love it so much though that i have no reason to try any other brands ,1
i thought that these muffins just had no chocolate taste and usually the chocolate flavor stands out in low carb products the texture was ok and i guess if you are dying for a muffin this would be adequate since it is portable and that is what is difficult to find in low carb products ,0
these chips are an experience unlike any other the texture and taste are absolutely exclusive it would seem a bit counter intuitive that the world is greatest jalapeno chip is made in the northwest as opposed to the southwest but let me tell you having lived in both places that tim is cascade has jalapeno potato chips down these are the chips that every other company is trying to make but they never will because these are the stars out of really ,1

i have been looking for an affordable source of sulfite free lemon juice since costco stopped carrying italian volcano brand locally this looked like a possible alternative the amazon price was not bad and it was called natural the ad above does not list the ingredients and i went to the sadaf website which also does not list the ingredients so i wrote their website and asked nicely if it contained sulfites and after a week i got back a terse reply that said read the label they have a label on their website but it does not have ingredients on it so i had to dig into googling for research and i finally found a complaint against their firm you can find it too just google sadaf lemon sulfites which accused them of falsely using the word natural despite the fact that their juice contains sulfites so despite their being seemingly intentionally obscure about this this product is full of sulfites and should be avoided by those who are sulfite sensitive the sadaf people do not make it easy to find this out and refused to answer me honestly my recommendation is to give this product a pass ,0

each bag is individually wrapped but not like other white tea from the same company prior to this order i bought white tea from a local store each bag was sealed in a wrapper each bag here is in an envelope i like the sealed wrapper better ,1
i previously purchased this product at whole foods the coconut milk was delicious and had a nice head of custard when it was left to sit for awhile i did not take notice of the country of origin of the previously purchased product but the one i received from amazon was from sri lanka i have to echo everybody else is review that the product was of poor quality there was no head of custard half the cans were dented and battered and the product was thin and not as good tasting i am going to find another brand because this product is now clearly inferior ,0
these are pretty good but i am very sure that i can bake much better one is myself for a lot cheaper is a lot of money these small little things ,1
illy issimo coffee drink cappucino cansi have seen these and other illy cans and packages on store shelves forever this is my first taste of one of their products boy am i late to the party this stuff is tasty i am a coffee drinker but i rarely get a cold coffee drink at starbucks or other shops i do get cappuccinos though this is different the instructions on the can are to not shake it so you are not going to get a frothy top foam i took a picture and will upload it it has a nice coffee with added ingredients color there is cocoa and milk in it as well as sugar at calories for ounces it is not that bad as sweetened drinks go still grams of sugar is a lot then again it tastes good so that is what is important with this type of beverage i liked it far more than i thought i would it passes the treat beverage test tasty refreshing and a bit of a caffeine boost great stuff ,1
this granola tastes so good i used to use granola bars with my morning meal not anymore this stuff has such a great flavor ,1
i have used this brand of parmesan exclusively now for four years since i discovered it and i will never use any other parmesan its delightful salty enough to replace the salt shaker i highly recommend using a microplane on this cheese to bring out the flavor and to provide great food coverage in a fine thin layer ecstacy on steamed broccoli a solid partner for any pasta dish and bonus its made in the usa ,1
this package is barely a pound even so you will get charged for shipping a supposed pounds the rawhide sticks are very small and hardly a treat for dogs medium or larger end of review maybe amazon will allow this review is it still too negative ,0
disclaimer i have a big sweet tooth i must say that i enjoyed these cookies a lot there is a nice chocolate coating on the outside that covers a peanut butter flavored creme coated oreo cookie half it is just the right ratio of cookie crunch to peanut butter creme to chocolate coating my only issue is that these cookies are a tad messy to eat it is fairly cool where i live right now and i noticed that the outside coating on these was already a little soft even before i picked up a cookie and then the coating definitely rubbed off on my fingers as i ate the cookies this is not an issue if you can wash your hands as soon as you are done eating but if not such as if you snack on these while driving you could end up making a mess ,1
i bought this product because it was organic and it contained the probiotic elements that my baby needed to help her digestive issues she does not eat it by itself i add it to the home made purees i make at home ,1

my husband has been buying these at a local convenience store for a higher price we have been unable to find them for sale by the box anywhere else ca not wait until the other flavor s are available here too the only downside was the day they were delivered was degrees after putting them in the fridge for a while they were fine ,1

i have been using minor is for many years now getting it at my local bj is warehouse for only about for the oz size sorry amazon i use it for many things not only making soup stock it is the most useful ingredient i have ever had sometimes when they have a sale i get some ahead and freeze it in the fridge it keeps for months never losing quality you can adjust the amount of sodium in your dish by how much you use yes it is high in sodium for preservation purposes and flavor it is amazing what you can do with minors noodles or pasta fresh vegetables and whatever leftover meat you have for a very quick tasty soup anytime this product has saved me much money over the years and i love it ,1
after getting my new irish setter puppy i sat on the internet and did alot of research on puppy dog food and just like if you put processed crappy food in your body your health declines giving dogs food that you can find in most super markets are made up of mostly corn gluten by products and things that sounds horrible i decided that my dogs would have a better life than that i did have some issues finally getting a food i felt comfortable giving him and one that agreed with his stomach at first i tried wellness puppy food and it gave my little guy loose stool so i slowly switched over to organix and have not had a problem since i will continue to use this until he gets to a year amazon sells this cheaper than anywhere i could find it and if you get the subscribe and save it makes it an even better deal i have never had an issue with the shipping or packaging ,1
i read an article last year about people in other countries who live to a great old age without heart disease and cancer one culture managed this according to the article by drinking as many as cups of raw cocoa per day i was interested in the possible health benefits so after some research i discovered navitas cacao on amazon and placed my order we have been hooked ever since read the label btw this product has fiber in it it took us a while to adjust our diets accordingly and for our bodies to adjust to the extra fiber we consume on average around cups of hot cocoa each per day i have priced it in health food stores and have yet to find such a good deal as amazon offers as for the product it really has changed our lives we have never looked forward to a cup of anything as much as we look forward to a cup of hot cocoa made with this powder i know it contributed to me losing pounds last year it is energizing delicious and satisfying and my husband loves it as much as i do my favorite way to drink it is in a cup of hot organic milk with a tablespoon or two of raw unprocessed honey you have to stir it extra well you can also bake with it add it to coffee for a cafe mocha beverage etc and it is low calorie if you love chocolate this is the ultimate in pure chocolate bliss do not expect it to be sweet this is dark no sugar added ,1

my family used this seasoning in chicken nuggets when i was a child and now i use it delicious whenever i make it for friends they ask for the recipe it is chicken breasts thaw if cups tablespoons nature is seasons or to taste my mom uses t per cup of flour oil to fill your fryer appropriately milk cups cut up the chicken breasts to make nuggets an inch wide and two inches long is about right but you do not need to be exact put the chicken in a bowl and fill it with milk until just covering the chicken let it sit in the refrigerator until you are ready to cook it in another bowl mix the flour and seasoning together heat the oil to degrees coat each piece of chicken in the flour mixture and fry two minutes and forty five seconds or until light golden in color they will darken a bit after they are out of the oil mmmm it is good with paula deen is corn casserole ,1

bought this paste in my local grocery store because it was the only thing they had plus i did not know any better was making curried butternut squash bisque for the first time the bisque was good but little did i know it could have been much better because this product was so expensive it took a whole jar to give my bisque a mild curry flavor i looked to amazon for an alternative found,0

great item will buy again i would recommend this to anyone great for parties great to have for work or at home when company comes over ,1
really like this product very good price we use them for compost scraps or storage of fresh vegetables we are able to reuse them even after they have contained compost scraps this sounds kind of yucky but we only do this if the compost is not full of liquidy things to begin with the bags are very thin but hold up really well to the aforementioned reusing of them moreover they hold alot of stuff and do not break during that tiny hike out to the compost pile worth noting i have taken them along camping for various uses as well but not reused ,1
my dogs love these chew toys and i cannot keep enough of these in the house they are hardy and my dogs cannot destruct them to the point of hurting themselves highly recommend ,1
great tasting salmon trio the only reason why i gave it four stars is because it was slightly salty for my taste would recommend it to anyone ,1
i do not eat much packed food but i saw a dr mcdougall is tortilla soup in the health food section of publix the ingredients are all natural vegan and are low in sodium and calories i loved the tortilla soup so i bought six packages along with packages of the chicken pilaf on amazon although i prefer the tortilla soup the pilaf is excellent for a dehydrated food product i will probably eat dr mcdougall is soups for lunch every day until i get burned out on them the reviewer who gave this pilaf one star said that there were only about four bites in the meal but i find it to be very filling the container says that the soups and pilaf will serve but this is really a meal for one the whole container contains calories ,1
honestly kashi is not one of my favorite brands but i am constantly on the lookout for calorie snacks or lunch bars to tide me over to dinner especially since i now have to lose weight for health reasons actually these bars are calories and they are pretty good they are moderately moist the banana taste is not overpowering or artificial and there is just a hint of chocolate they are not overly sweet either the first ingredient listed is apple puree concentrate the rest of the ingredient list is long but amazingly percent of the ingredients are recognizable and pronounceable what i did not like is that when biting into the bar it tended to crumble not good at the computer i solved this by just cutting up the bar into pieces the other thing is that for a snack i personally would not pay more than cents apiece for these ,1
love potato chips but i can not stand the fact that they can go stale so fast once they have been open i used to have packages on top of the refrigerator with handfuls of chips in them even though they had been resealed clipped and re clipped we had seen the pack of regular pringles in the store and started purchasing them could not find the assorted flavors until i went to amazon in this day and age of gas prices i go there quite often rather than drive around to many stores love the assorted packs thank you amazon ,1
as i continued to drink this tea i became annoyed by a distinct minty taste it has one of the bags tasted so minty i thought they slipped a bag of their green tea mint into the box it really is that noticeable and is not a quality i look for in an everyday green tea i will not be buying this again only a few bags are in the box now and i am struggling to finish them i am going to go back to but it costs much more per box than the eden brand where i shop ,0
yes this product is expensive buy it in the big box stores for about or buy it online and pay the shipping your choice the product is my fav for making stove top popcorn and company never fails to ask for it ,1
my husband loves hot sause especially made from habanero his favorite was twisted pepper brand but they quit making it so we have been on a search recieved this yesterday and he tried it with his eggs this morning he gave it a thumbs up so we will be purchasing it again ,1
i only had the bbq flavor since the variety pack was oos at the time i ordered this was the first time i ate these and they are much better than i expected i read the reviews and saw that it got a lot of praises but still skeptical since people is taste buds are not the same once i received it tried a bag and these are great they are not greasy at all and pack a lot of flavor i rather eat these whenever i feel like i need a snack than original potatoes chips or something that is a bit greasy either way these are great go to their website and see if you can find a vendor near you buy a bag to try out and if you love it just keep getting more from your retail store or buy em cheaper here on amazon ,1
my cat loves greenies she is at her bowl meowing for the treats morning noon and night she gets them three times each day that is what she wants to eat the other food is ok but greenies are ice cream for her ,1
i like this combination good way to get the veggies in along with the fruit the flavor which sounds odd to an adult i will admit went down with no complaints ,1
this is really great restaurant quality hummus i love it in sandwiches and as a dip dsomeone mentioned to try adding a little more water than usual and maybe some cooking oil to make it more spreadable the only downside is that this hummus has a lemony after taste and quite a bit of sodium per box i would definitely recommend this to my friends and family i would buy it again if i did not already have more boxes to eat doh and it is a vegan food ,1
i have had community coffee before never this blend dark rich not bitter excellent cup of coffee has become my favorite ,1
these look just like the banana candy runts however they do not taste like them i used them more for look then taste i used them as a cake topper and sprinkled them on top of a banana flavored sheet cake underlying a chocolate monkey cake the looked great and they were a hit with the kids ,1
in the weight control program that i follow peanut butter is either a fat or a protein with that in mind i have tried different peanut butters and have narrowed my preferences down to two brands maranatha being one my reasons organic made with certified organic peanuts and if that is important to you then maranatha is a great choice additives no hydrogenated oils no sugar added no nothing except for a tiny trace of salt but this does not taste salty at all great taste this should have been first maranatha has a mild mellow peanutty taste i really do like it great texture truly smooth and creamy easy to spread even on soft breadhint this is not homogenized the oil is on the top of the peanut butter when you open the jar you have to mix it in but fear not stick a butter knife down into the middle of the jar and move it ever so slightly creating an opening into which the oil can flow repeat this a few times and most of the oil will be gone from the top stir and then enjoy you will not have to mix again summary a wonderful way to get those fat allowances from a healthful type of fat this peanut butter has made my weight control easier because i substitute it for far less satisfying fats and it seems as though i am eating something sinfully sensational ,1
this is a great deal for this coffee it is my favorite and amazon is a really good place to buy it ,1
i am not sure why but this particular brand has a very strong offensive smell i have used different brands before and it barely had a smell this brand has a terrible smell which affected the taste of the food very disappointed especially because the shipping cost more than the actual arrowroot flour ,0
a lot of people complained about the taste so i expected them to taste bad but they taste fine and the kids loved them they are a great party pleaser a lb box was enough for me to do or so gift bags with about blocks each ,1
an excellent full bodied tea for everyday use it brews quickly and gives the right amount of flavor and satisfaction the pyramid bags do the trick i have always been a life long loose leaf tea drinker which tastes awesome but is quite time consuming and messy as time went by life has gotten busier and pg tips was a godsend i boil water in an automatic kettle and pour over one tea bag steep for mins and enjoy it with a splash of milk and sugar amazing i have signed up for the automatic delivery which by far gives the best price and i never run out ,1
i use this practically every day in soups sauces braises it is a great broth good flavor i love that it is organic and low sodium ,1
this chili verde is outstanding the pork is of course a bit well done but for a canned product it is o k the absolute best thing about this stuff is the green sauce just the right amount of heat very savory wish they just sold the sauce i will add my own pork great product ,1
this is my third vino italiano kit and i made a double batch of this tuscany rosso magnifico to fill a liter oak barrel i have i want to give this kit every opportunity to shine it is going to be my house table wine to enjoy with everyday meals while i wait for some of my upper end wine kits to fully mature a couple of hints to better appreciate these vino italiano wine have realistic expectations these kits make a nice light to medium bodied wine beautifully red and brilliant in the glass they are light and food friendy wines and not necessarily great representations of their varietal but if you are expecting something full bodied and inky dark like a napa cabernet you are setting yourself up to be disappointed keep in mind this bottle of wine cost you to make the cost of bottles does not count you can reuse them over and over stay these wines will improve with time in the bottle while it is hard to resist dipping into your supply for weekly tastings six months to a year in the bottle will make for a much nicer less green tasting wine i will add more to this review after i bottle this wine but i will say that it is drinking better than the valpolicella did at this early stage less dry than the valpolicella with a nice balance of both fruit and tannins i think i will be proud to call this rosso magnifico my house red ,1
these tahitian vanilla beans were just what i was looking for i was very glad that they were more or less the same size thickness however there were a couple in one of my orders and one bean in another that had some mould growing on them so i had to toss some that was the only downside they even arrived a little early too ,1
this is the best tasting bar on the market they only use good food no junk the flavor is just awesome you cant go wrong with these bars ,1
definitely one of the better tasting hot sauces not the hottest on the market but with all the additional fruits in the ingredients it was not made to be the hottest try this in ketchup with french fries the ketchup dilutes some of the heat but leaves the great taste stars,1
this baby food tastes good the pouches are great open it squeeze some out and put the lid back on to easily save the rest for later my little guy liked this it did constipate him though the broccoli i think i am planning to purchase other flavors soon ,1
i have been buying this tea for about years now and it is my all time favorite the silk like pouch the tea comes in allows the flavors of the tea to come through without the papery taste you get from other tea bags this tea is worth the extra expense ,1
if you read the first review and then read the company literature it will become obvious that the review was either written by an employee or was copied from the literature i will say the cheese straws are the best i have ever tasted from the flavor to the crunchy feel in my mouth i am addicted to aunt lizzies cheese straws the negative customer service is non existent an order that was placed on the internet was subsequently lost even though i received a confirmation via email i was offered no discount or upgraded shipping no additional product with my order no discount on my next order not even an apology for the day delay just an excuse that the email order was lost and that her it guy would be on the problem tomorrow personally i can count the number of times an email has been lost over the last years on one hand this is not the first problem i have had with an order they do not give a tracking number with each order and when asked for one after the order is placed the odds of getting one are i have had so many problems with my orders i will go without my aunt lizzies cheese straws i will miss them greatly however i need the hassle associated with ordering them less than i need the cheese straws ann i wish you the best in the future and suggest you participate in customer service training classes to refrain from losing additional customers in the future follow up i just received an email notifying me that my order shipped on the aug i have not placed an order what more can they do ,1
nothing to say about the cookies but there was no expiry date on the boxes the boxes look like they have been in the warehouse for years i have no idea how old they are very disappointed ,0
product was clean and in a good package as i could not find this item locally i looked to amazon price seemed a touch high except i have not shopped mung dal recently and that might not be fair in any event i was glad to get it anyway i purchased it with tumric spice also and was impressed by the packaging on both items these people seem to take care of their products ,1
i have never been able to find the mocha flavor in any local market so i thought i would give this a try i absolutely love this flavor it makes my morning start off with a smile i am so glad i bought the box pack it should last me at least months i only use one packet per my morning coffee and some creamer and it tastes like what you might buy at starbucks i have tried the vanilla and hazelnut but the mocha is by far my favorite flavor thank you amazon for selling splenda flavors for coffee ,1
we have been buying caribou blend k cups for a couple of years it is a fine medium blend that we and everyone that we have served it to loves we usually order it in larger quantities to try and save some money since we go through it fairly quickly the last order we placed for x boxes was fulfilled with the k cups with green color labels the older labels were orange around the edges the taste of this new k cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product it is not drinkable we have written to caribou and have been waiting for a response but nothing yet i will update if i hear anything do not buy this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it you will not get the same thing and this coffee is truly terrible deserves stars update a note from caribou corporate thank you for taking the time to contact us we certainly apologize for any confusion recently the packaging for caribou blend k cups did change previously the regular blend had an orange band and the decaf had a green band the new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band the coffee itself has not changed simply the label there are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste the change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them freshness also coffee is an agricultural crop that varies with weather and other environmental factors our roastmasters put in a lot of time and attention to provide a consistency when roasting the coffee beans we do apologize for any confusion and please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you sincerely lindacaribou coffee customer relationsthe coffee is dramatically different but they will not admit to the change oh well goodbye caribou coffee ,0
on the suggestion of a friend i bought these bay leaves in the hopes they would stop my home is ant infestation so far they seem to work fairly well but i still see a stream of ants leaving the bottom on my laptop once it is turned on at least the insects no longer crawl on the keyboard there are enough bay leaves in that large bag to ward off every ant in california is sonoma county for years to come grinning ,1
pure is definately better i ve used it several times have gotten several complements on the results love it ,1
it is just an apple nothing added ingredients fuji apple it is portable non perishable crunchy tasty and the kids love it it is the snack you can always say yes to they are also great for grownups keep a few at your desk or in your car i love the apple and pear flavors the kids love those and the strawberry banana warning the strawberry powder makes a bit of a mess but not much more so than fresh strawberries do ,1
a great product it comes out much better if made thin also pre bake the dough a little to make crispy then put sauce and cheese on and bake again it is a few steps but out of all the gf pizza products we have tasted it is by far the best ,1
this made my milk production go way up the taste is strong but with some honey it is great it will make you smell like maple syrup so do not freak out my husband actually kind of liked it ,1
i have two airedales they are not fussy eaters or snackers but each gets a greenie at bedtime we let them out in the yard for a bit before they go to bed and all i have to do is say time for your greenies to make them race for the house and dance around until they get that bedtime snack it is their special treat and i love the fact that they actually have to chew them moderately slowly instead of just inhaling them the only drawback is that they are expensive ,1
what can i say except excellent excellent excellent i have gotten this item several times in the past and have enjoyed it each time it arrives fresh every time the rapid fast shipping time is always a plus ,1
i thought these smelled and tasted like regular kisses just a different texture it is almost like they made them with carbonated milk or something so you end up with something like porous or whipped chocolate only on the inside the outside looks the same as regular ones i did think they melted more easily in my mouth but i ended up almost feeling there was not enough chocolate in my mouth after it did i think they are taste good enough but i do not really see the need for shrinking the overall density an already small thing they may have a better purpose than just eating maybe on cookies or desserts where the solid ones are hard to bite through or after dinner when you just want a little taste of something they may also be very good dropped into a hot drink since the texture would allow them to melt more easily there is not much caloric difference calories in of these opposed to calories in regular ones so if you are thinking you could eat twice as many as these too bad ha ha if you ever had a choco lite bar in the is these are just like those i think i might like these even more if they had a little mint flavor in them that would make a nice little lighter textured treat ,1
i could not find this at my local asian grocery store so i ordered it online so much better than the plain seaweed sesame this furikake is seriously delicious i am buying this kind from now on ,1
this is a fantastic honey most honeys you get a hint of what flower it came from this one you can really taste the key lime i grew up on the florida keys and ate key limes all the time and this is it you will not be sorry to purchase this ,1
original review do not you hate how standard equivalent cfl bulbs are always huge and will not fit into a normal lamp or overhead fixture well look no further than this product finally a compact equivalent cfl light bulb these bulbs put out equivalent light to bulbs using only and are very compact they are the same physical size as a normal light bulb i needed these for several of my overhead lights and lamps which could not take a larger sized bulb but that i still wanted to put a bright cfl bulb into these bulbs produce a comfortable warm white color that is not blue at all the color is perfect almost identical to an incandescent bulb according to the packaging these bulbs are supposed to last for hours that is much longer than the lifespan of a standard bulb also all six bulbs arrived very well packaged and all of them work great so far none were broken update after months of light use one of these bulbs started flickering and turning off randomly while the switch was in the on position i replaced it with another of the same type of bulb and the problem went away am now questioning the supposed hour lifespan that these are supposed to deliver update after months of normal use another bulb has started flickering and turning off randomly just like the first one that went bad and had to be replaced also stay away from these bulbs they do not last anything close to hours more like hours frankly for the price i paid for these i expected better quality ,0
these peanuts are delicious but the price really went up i just ordered them in march and the price went up by about or very disappointed ,1
there is nothing bad to say i love it on bread toast bagels and fruit bread i grew up on this in england ,1
these bergin cashew nuts are excellent quality and have such flavour a great product to add to your nutritional profile rich in omega is and so many other nutrients reviewed by ,1
i used to really like this stuff when it first came out years ago but now i see it has bacon in it why mess up on a good thing due to religous reasons i can no longer eat this because of the pork bacon bits it was a quick meal for a poor single girl on her own way back then i love anything ranch but why did then mess this up ,0
this is by far the best peanut butter i have ever had this is all i need if stranded on a desert island there is an easy way to stir this peanut butter take a hand drill and attach a beater from a hand mixer the hand mixer itself is not powerful enough ,1
i make chocolate shakes with this and they are delicious my shakes are actually smoothies made with frozen organic bananas flax seed small amount of soy milk and then tb of this along with some caco nibs tossed in delicious nancy rectorauthor of a painful truth the entrapment of america is sick or how being ill got me arrested ,1
i love the tarragon in this package and morton bassett in general the herbs are always fresh and there are a lot of them tarragon is one of my favorite herbs and this company packages and preserves the best dried tarragon it is great in just about anything but i like it in french or italian dishes that use anything with olive oil vinegar eggs creamy salad dressings or even tomato sauce ,1
this stuff is very good and hot it has a nice after burn watch out if you eat this with soups as it intensifies with heat if you like hot you will love this i love this with chicken ,1
the name says everthing about this lovely tea sweet chamomile apple is like drinking a golden delicious apple the scent is strongly fruity and chamomile the flavor is apple chamomile and honey a wonderful golden flavor that is soothing and while sweet not cloying chamomile tea is known for being a nerve tonic settling upset stomachs and soothing menstrual cramps and headaches having a cup before bedtime is a nice way to relax celestial seasonings gets extra points for their packaging they utilize natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they do not package each tea bag individually instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it it keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag the art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface ,1
this instant coffee taste great and dissolves quickly i love that it is organic it is good for the environment and me ,1
with winter approaching i bought this as a trial i was concerned that it would taste watered down because i feel that many of the keuring coffees taste that way i like the extra bold varieties or starbucks italian roast on my own k cup i was actually rather pleasantly surprised as to how much like real hot cocoa it tasted not watered down and not too sweet it is not gourmet but this winter when you want a quick cup of hot cocoa after shoveling snow or playing outside this will do nicely ,1
i have used keurig coffee makers since and tried all the top selling k cups by far the best k cup coffee is by coffee people and their best product is jet fuel would love to see their kona return b c it was the second best k cup ,1
this stuff tastes ok but it coats the popcorn with such an unattractive color that it is not very appetizing we dumped it after a couple batches ,0
i received my popcorn on december the bag is dated sept so it was either packaged months ago or it expired months ago either way it is as chewy as the supermarket junk i was hoping to avoid i was fooled by all the great reviews luckily it was only sixteen bucks expensive for chicken feed i know but thats where its going i will try the great northern brand next but am not very hopeful after this huge bag of jaw exerciser as always amazon is shipping and packaging were great just a lousy product ,0
i have been using this product in a particular recipe called ravishing rice for almost years and all of a sudden i could not find it cup a soup just does not work of course i did not exactly need a case but at my age i should never have to order it again i just make this particular casserole about times a year thanks amazon now if you could only come up with garlic cheese and jalapeno cheese that kraft has discontinued you would really make my day ,1
costco warehouse consistently delivers on any product they decide on stamping their kirkland logo on their sweetener is definitely the best on the market in terms of price but most importantly taste i am a costco member and have been using this brand of sweetener for at least years the sachets lasts me almost years i use it almost every day since i am a prodigious drinker of hot teas even in degree weather i also use the sweetener in baking cookies drinking coffee on occasion and for anything else that requires a sweet taste there is no aftertaste none even stevia can be exceedingly bitter if too much is used not with the kirkland sweetener too much just results in it tasting too sweet that is all it is just like using white sugar but without all the debilitating side effects of using such a toxin it is also much better to buy this product from any of the costco warehouses dotted around the u s it is well worth paying the yearly membership with all the items you can buy there at fantastic prices the sweetener retails for under at a costco warehouse ,1
i ordered bags of spice tea bags tea bags in each container only bag was sent i paid for bags i called and another bag is being sent to correct the order ,1
this might cost a bit more than other store bought popcorn but it is really worth it it works so perfectly in my whirly pop maker great twosome ,1
i have a rhodesian ridgeback prior to purchasing this product i used to purchase blue buffalo food for my fur child but after i was laid off i did some research to see if i could find a product of the same caliber for less money prior to ordering dog food on amazon i used to drive to the pet store every month pay taxes and carry the bag through the store to my car out of my car and finally home i use to spend over at the pet store for of dog food plus my time gas and energy i now pay under for lbs of food shipped to my doorstep for free rather than over for lbs plus the drive etc my dog and i love this food and are really pleased that we made the switch ,1
products came as planned but i had like two bags that were already opened im sure it was because oversight during product etc but overall love my cheez its ,1
have purchased this product several times and we are pleased it is a good value for the money compared with the retail stores ,1
do not like it at all can not even give it away i wasted my money i feel the advertising was very misleading ,0
no these are not your kid is honey grahams but they are definitely a staple in my house the texture is hearty and substantial with a not too sweet honey flavour i have also used them to make a crust for a lemon cheesecake and the crust stayed crisp for three or four days ,1
a delightful flavor in all the recipes i have tried all of the cans i ordered however were very dented which concerned me initially i just used them more quickly and so far no ill effects i am pleased to say i am assuming the shipment passed through the daycare of the facility where the children had a time tossing the cans around i was pleased all in all but will specify undented cans if i order again you may want to also ,1
i have been drinking this tea for years it is the best on the market for a reasonable price since i drink a lot of this tea i have always tried to buy this larger sized package to save a bit of money but the larger size is not sold in very many places so i end up buying the smaller size for what feels like too much money plus i just have to buy a lot of them now i have hit upon the perfect formula buy these larger boxes in bulk at super low prices on a regular basis i was just reminded of what a great deal this is because i am on vacation and had to buy the smaller packages here for a package of i paid almost what i pay here for you drink a lot of tea you can go wrong here ,1
i tried this while i was out of state and i am hooked i did not know how available it was in my area it just takes some searching the best ginger ale out there i use this as a treat since it is fairly healthy and mildly sweet if you do not want to order online you can usually find it at whole foods and kroger ,1
i have tried several yogi tea flavors and this has to be one of my favorites when you drink yogi tea you know the taste is going to be out of ordinary for me it took a couple tries to get used to some flavors however this one i enjoyed it from my very first cup now i drink it daily i found that if i drink this tea first in the morning before i eat anything else i do not crave for coffee or sweet for the day if i choose to drink coffee first i notice that i feel hungry sooner and want to eat more now i have this healthy fasting tea as my secret weapon to curb my craving i am just thrilled to have something help me eating less two thumbs up yogi ,1
have you ever discovered something that you always want to have on hand how could all that flavor in such a little piece of hard candy i do not know but pop one in your mouth and you have a glass of tea swimming around even if you are a diabetic the sugar carbs a low for or two mmmmm good ,1
i love the fruit leather definitely will purchase again ,1
i was a bit hesitant when i first ordered this coffee because i am the only one who drinks coffee and if i was not happy with them i would be drinking coffee unhappily for quite sometime fortunately i was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was exactly what i was looking for and am enjoying them each day when i wake up and at times during the day i have served them to friends when they come to visit and they have complimented me on how good the cup of coffee is i tell them that it was all done with the keurig brewer and unfortunately i had nothing to do with that cup of coffee they smile and enjoy their coffee i will be ordering this assortment again when the current one gets towards the end ,1
to each his her own i was suckered into buying a case on a friday sale i am now still trying to give them away a package at a time you want one they are blended pureed formed into peapods but not any remote resemblance of an actual green bean i hate them although one of my sister in laws and parents have ordered more cases like i said to each his her own i personally hate them ,0
this pasta tastes like regular pasta i eat along with my husbad who has to eat gluten free ,1
there are literally hundreds of jerky type products out there this is simply my favorite real strips of beef not ground up hamberger that tastes like meat instead of preservatives without teriyaki or any other flavoring or sauce good price good product and great taste you will be happy with this one when i am looking for a non sugary snack i reach for this first ,1
best glutenfree bread on the market i add a little honey with the yeast and then mix as directed great bread,1
we were given this product as a gift ok i can forgive the fact that i am a pastry chef and i was given a mix for a gift but i have always made my own frosting from scratch and have for years it is one of the easiest things to make make your cake from a mix if you want but i looked at the back of this box to see what was in it and seriously it is just powdered sugar cents worth salt cents worth and vanilla maybe cents worth i mean i am glad that this small company is making themselves some money but really you should spend your money on other more difficult to make items or all the medical bills that come along with the issues of gluten allergy honestly folks here is all you do for awesome frosting box oz of powdered sugar put it in a bowl pinch salt put it in the bowl teaspoon vanilla in the bowl cup margarine at room temp in the bowl tbl soy milk or other milk in the bowl mix it all up with a mixer till it is light and fluffy about minutes if you want chocolate add tbl of cocoa powder and another tbl of milk,0
this is just like the halloumi my buddies sister makes in cyprus really good i mean i thought i was in cyprus hope you all try it you will not regret it ,1
i have used this product for years and i absolutely love it the calories are next to nothing and it gives you the push to get through a tough workout ,1
this is the only food i will feed my cats they love it it is the best thing to give your pets,1
i travel for a living and i sometimes eat in places where the food needs all the help it can get these hot sauce packets are perfect to carry in my purse to liven up most dishes i love it on pizza sandwiches and anything with a tomato based sauce if you love hot sauce and want portability these are essential ,1
many instant coffees cannot be dissolved in cold water but that is not a problem with it the best part is that it tastes just like freshly made starbucks at a fraction of the price ,1
it is probably been over years since i last bought instant coffee but i am in a temporary situation separated from my beloved bodum french press as well as drinking alone sigh so i needed something convenient very very pleasantly surprised by the full bodied and satisfying taste of this coffee ,1
i am a big fan of kashi foods in general but these bars are my absolute favorite i love the crunchy chewy texture and the chocolate peanut flavor is really good and not too sweet they remind me of a healthier version of home made special k bars kind of like a peanut butter rice krispie bar with chocolate on top ,1
at first you think that these chips are not all that spicy but the spice will grow on you with each bite they are really very good ,1
the taste quality of this individually wrapped cookie was disappointing nothing like i expected wanted a rich homebaked type cookie something special individually packaged these cookies were described as premium so that is what i expected another brand of choc chip cookies packaged in bulk taste better than these ,0
this hot sauce is absolutely amazing it is not so spicy that you cannot feel your mouth but it still gives that slow burn the flavor is great and i try it on and in everything i can thanks to all those putting forth effort to create a delicious product ,1
to explain the product description lists the item as milk chocolate but it is actually dark chocolate for some this can mean the difference in the gift being eaten or sat on a table for months in my case the gifted person does not like dark chocolate but the cookies are great looking in appearance they got here in a reasonable time period in time for the day in question the container is a clear plastic and clear side top attached to a white bottom with trim ,1
i add this into my green monster smoothies every morning and i love knowing that i am getting great nutrition first thing in the morning ,1
somewhere along the line my toddler got introduced to marshmellows perhaps it was due to the fact that my wife uses them in cooking with a few items sweet potatoes come to mind in any case i started using them as little rewards when the boy would do something right as desert after a meal and as a sprinkling of things in his cereal he just loves marshmellows i try to keep the candy content of his diet down to a minimum so i switched over to the smaller miniature marshmellows he barely noticed in any case the kraft brand is excellent they are nice and tasty and fresh perhaps with the next pack i will try some of the flavored varieties gary peterson,1
this noodle works the best with my low carb diet i always have a hard time thinking of what i can eat when i am on my low card diet i can be satisfied because i am eating noodles and i will be sticking to my low carb diet the noodles taste great easy to cook ,1
we used to have a membership at one of the wholesale clubs where we would purchase this product my wife loves the large size as she uses garlic in many of her recipes the quality seems consistently good and now i just order it through amazon without having to pay an annual fee ,1
i have to confess that i buy products base on reviews and i do not do my own homework to return the favor this time i think i should warn other people about this product my baby grew up to toddler drinking formula since he was months old we tried several brands until we landed in one that it is not enfamil and i will not mention for the sake of the credibiliy of this review we wanted to keep with the nutrition supplements that baby formulas provide to my toddler and enfagrow provided a good option the issue the major issue is that it simple taste ugly adults may tell you that any baby food will taste ugly anyway but me and my toddler agreed that bitterness and awful taste is the best describer for this product it has been such a shock that he does not drink anything that looks like milk anymore so save your time and money if your toddler already knows the taste of real milk he she will just pull this one away now i have to mix milk with other things to try to make him like it again about the nutrients well i am still searching for a better alternative or at least with better taste what is the point of having all those nutrients in this powder milk when the baby will not drink it just a thought,0
i have the mini keurig these do not work in that maker and they are such a hassle to get them on the k cup i bought some metal ones on amazon that just sit on the top of the k cup and they work like a charm and it takes seconds to do it i wasted bucks on these plastic cumbersome ones save your money or get the metal ones ,0
you know you have got a good product when you can use it for your hair and then use it for your body and for a pizza dish this is a versatile product from a company my family has trusted for quite some time the oil is not only yummy but oh so good for the hair of anyone who has issues with dryness i deep condition with it and also use it in a shealoe mix before styling my hair it has not failed me yet it has lasted me about four months and i am just now in need of a new bottle a little bit truly goes a long way ,1
my family is from the west indies this is a little sweeter than we are used to but i would still say it is delicious it is the best i have had where i did not literally stick the straw in the coconut ,1
after reading the reviews i tried it i love it but it takes so much concentrate for one cup it is bit pricy for the amount of cups however i would buy it again ,1
when i found these at my local grocery i was certain they would not taste great but thought it was worth a try i was very surprised these are great and i am very picky about my dark chocolate is it as good as my dark ghirardelli chocolate bars well no but it is very very good and worth the switch to be free of gluten and dairy ,1
i could not wait to receive these cafe mocha flavored k cups and try them i was sadly disappointed in the first sip there was a funny after taste i tried it again funny after taste was still present just to make sure it was not just me i had other co workers try it too and they also thought it tasted funny do not waste your money ,0
i have been craving this tea ever since i moved to cleveland where it is not available what a joy to find it available through amazon good earth original is a tea for people who like a sweet and spicy tea cinnamon is the main note followed by orange rosehip and just a touch of mint the tea does contain artificial flavorings which is the only downside it is already sweet without any additional sugar but a bit of honey really makes the flavor pop great hot or cold in fact i am going to go have a cup right now ,1
the transaction was smooth and the product was received in a timely manner i look forward to purchasing other goods through amazon ,1
i can only say that my dog loves them what else is there yum they are rather large so i put one on top of his filled dinner dish every night as a special treat he goes for it first ,1
special k protein plus is by far my favorite cereal the one that packs the biggest nutritional wallop out there in cereal land even the wimpishly modest portion of delivers dv of protein not counting the milk you will add my usual portion of this is bigger on top of it i sprinkle a measure of kosher whey protein isolate about dv then i dump sliced fresh fruit on top say a banana a peach or nectarine pitted cherries blueberries blackberries raspberries yellow raspberries yes often all at the same time finally pour in enough lactaid milk to suit my taste not only is this delicious nutritious healthful it gives you at least as much protein as you would get from a gigantic steak and it is a lot better for you easier to digest try it ,1
we started buying these on line when clams became hard to come by locally these are great quality and make a delicious mix with garlic olive oil and linguini a staple meal at our house goes well with malbec ,1
i have a yorkiechon puppy that loves this treat being lamb and rice i think its great for his digestive system i will buy it again ,1
this energy does not excel in any area compared to other energy drinks and the promised new taste was not all that exciting but it was not unpleasant either it gives a good boost to your energy levels for a few hours all in all this is a drink to add to the long list of new drinks on the market and i would buy it if there was a good deal on it ,1
this is by far my families favorite pancake and waffle mix i have tried so many and nothing compares to the light fluffy pancakes this mix makes it is easy to put together and i use it on even the busiest mornings i highly recommend this especially for those looking for a replacement for a gluten mix it tastes great ,1
i am a big fan of all pg tips tea it is of good quality and the decaffinated is not much different than the others my family is from england so we are somewhat tea snobs and will not drink any other tea ,1
both of our dogs and our cat love these treats we do not seem to have anyone around our area that carriesthem i find that all the animals in our lives love them ,1
good product had a problem with order wrote a review i was contacted by seller problem resolved within two days i am truly pleased with the fast response from seller ,1
i had a necrotic wound after abdominal surgery nothing helped i was grasping at straws and i read good things about wound honey so i gave it a go it paid off the wound stopped with the spreading of dead tissue and began to heal i just ordered it again for a surgery in november ,1
yay no more expensive starbucks chai tea lattes i love a cup when my day is finished and i can sit and unwind not too sweet no after taste just yummyalso good cold as well ,1
if you enjoy flavored coffee and like dark chocolate this is the coffee for you the chocolate flavor is super rich in fact for my taste i made the coffee a second time and stronger because at first the chocolate flavor seemed to diminsh any taste of coffee strong it makes a very nice espresso and we especially like it for after dinner coffee due to the sweetness it is not my morning brew but later in the day delish ,1
the flavor is very pleasant spicy and rich but not the least bit hot imho it is the easiest sauce to make takes no time and can not be screwed up only negative thing in my book is the sodium level which a tad too high ,1
best rasher of bacon i have had since scotland all meat and very little fat really great tasting like being home it is too bad it is not generally available in the us or what passes for bacon here ,1
i was never a fan of instant coffee until starbuck is came out with via now a bag of these little packets is one of the first things into my suitcase when i travel which is often even in good hotels the quality of the coffee service in the room is quite variable and now i know i will have a decent cup of coffee no matter what the hotel offers ,1
i enjoy erin baker homestyle granola with the fruit and nut included it has almost the same amount of calories in cup as other granolas have in cup i find it very satisfying with somee added strawberries or blueberries and it holds me until lunchtime it gives me a lot of energy for the morning i will ofen snack on it in the evening or have it for lunch with a container of yogurt the only negative is that it dose not have a lot of fruit and nuts ,1
expensive but so far is the best green tea i could find coconut green is my favorite flavor amazing i will definitely order more ,1
it mixes very easy and tastes great without an aftertaste i highly recommend it ,1
this is a tx fav but not living there anymore decided that i needed a taste of home and found it right here drink up ,1
you might equate bitter with a bad review but no the slight pucker this tea provides when slightly over brewed provides an excellent tartness to be balanced with a dark wildflower honey this combination is by far my favorite tea ,1
i enjoy this india spice tea it is one of my favoritebecause it has a rich flavor i usually add a green tea actually white tea for the antioxidant benefits of greenor white tea the taste of the tea is the india spice ann,1
really good love the smokey apple taste we were actually looking for a different flavor but it was not available any where we looked so we decided to try the smokey apple cinnamon and we were not disappointed ,1
with dogs it is important to cut the vet bills and this product recommended by our vet years ago has helped to get our dogs healthy checkups our dogs look forward to them once a day ,1
this is a nice addition to heartland is group of granola products the original is still the best but if you want fruit and nut added to your granola this tastes very good too ,1
while i swear by this product and have ordered it several times i did not find it well packed this time usually it is come in a box but this time the packs were just jammed into a padded envelope so the actual pockets were smashed still usable just not in great shape i think the supplier should go back to using a box ,1
i try to avoid gluten so cereals have pretty much become a thing of the past for me i was very excited to try a gluten free cereal if you only care about the taste then this cereal is fairly enjoyable however it is advertised as a health food and this is where i run into issues the first ingredients are whole grain corn meal evaporated cane juice brown rice flour and inulin they are all organic but corn is one of the worst things that you can put into your body and it appears to be the bulk of this cereal well except for the evaporated cane juice aka sugar the package advertises is as a good source of fiber and there are only grams of fiber not bad but not great and only gram of fat how can this be high in fatty acids when there is only gram or possibly less per serving then you look at the nutrient profile vitamin a vitamin c calcium guess this is a step up from normal junk food cereal but i think it falls short of what it advertises i do not think i will purchase any more ,0
i love this coffee it is totally delicious at first sip of the day first feeling washing over you that it is time to wake up it is smooth not bitter and makes me say ahhhh every single time want to be upfront that i am more a medium light and flavored coffee drinker so i am not sure the dark roast fans will get that same feeling packaging was fine none of the cups were damaged in shipping ,1
the coffee is delicious however i wish seneco would make flavor decaffeinated coffee it is also a little costly compare to the coffee you get in the can or pack but the coffee is always fresh per cup ,1
hidden valley seasoning salad dressing is a greatproduct however i found out that i could have save in cost if i bought it at sam is ,1
i belong to a wine tasting group that has somehow evolved devolved into a competitive hors d oeuvres club no cheese and crackers for this group even though that is what would probably complement wine the best and then one of our group brought these chips they are just delightful without being fussy e g not spicy salty overdone these are plain and go with everything from dips to hummus to cheese any cheese i love to put them in the bottom of a soup bowl and then pour tomato soup over them they are great on salads too a definite find ,1
black tiger has a very nice full flavor without pronounced acidity newman is own medium kinda sorta approaches this but with that edgy bite as sold at warehouse stores cheaper i drink the black tiger at a cup or two a day and the cheaper newman is otherwise however my latest shipment came in with only k cups in the box not made this an even more expensive purchase grunt i must say that amazon was really really great on another subscription purchase that was messed up in shipment so i complained on packaging feedback hopefully that works in all my years shopping amazon this is only the second foul up i love prime and subscriptions yay for amazon ,1
only recently have i discovered the satisying interesting spectrum offlavors being offered by this product the lemon is my current favorite but i have tried several of the others and find them equally satisfying these food bars are low in calories high in nutrition handy snack size and perfect for any folks with certain dietary limitations unfortunately i have many food allergies found in most of the commercial snacks on the market so these are very welcome to me check the ingredient panel and be pleasantly surprised ,1
my wife and i have have gone through a complete package of this it is so easy to use and it taste great i highly recommend this product ,1
based on previous reviews and the fact that it seems to use less plastic in the k cup packaging i tried this coffee in general i prefer a fairly bold coffee and i am very impressed with the flavor of this coffee i prefer it to the donut shop coffee and find it comparable with the starbucks coffees i have tried the pods work terrific in my keurig there have been no leaks explosions etc although i still feel guilty for the waste i am creating with all of these individual pods i am throwing in the trash i do not feel as guilty as i did with the full plastic pods from other manufacturers i actually just went in and subscribed to a monthly shipment you can not beat the price for the quality and convenience ,1
at first i tried this because of the price and free shipping i had never heard of it before my dogs love this so i say it is great the tiny ones toy poodles get the almost straight food the others get this mixed with their bil jac i am impressed with the ingredients not full of corn another thing i noticed every time i have fed my dogs any brand of straight canned dog food with the exception of science diet they had diarrhea not with this one not even one of them had it that is a good thing i ordered two more cases and will continue the price is reasonable too and free shipping with amazon prime or free shipping with purchase over only fault i could find in my opinion is that the product has lamb i will not eat lamb and have never before bought any dog food with lamb or veal in it i do not like the way the animals are treated and lambs are sweet baby cuddly things it makes me sad unfortunately this company uses lamb in most everything for some reason i have never seen this before in a dog food product they might have one or two items with lamb but not most all they do have the chicken and rice without lamb regardless at this time i plan on ordering this dog food monthly for my dogs as they love it so much and other than lamb i am impressed with the ingredients ,1
the reviews about beneful dry dog food formula generally are negative focusing on ingredients animal health there are also a number of negative side effects reported you can find this information if you have google fu that said i am not a nutritionist or a scientist or a veterinarian and i will not pretend to be will not comment on those aspects however i can comment on how the dogs reacted to this food they loved it there were no food allergies or reactions as others have reported the food bits were about the same size as other food products on the market so this formula might not be ideal for smaller dogs ,1
i really should not have to say anything else about this product open it and smell it and you will literally feel like you are smelling vomit it is amazing how bad this product tastes do not touch this garbage with a foot nacho barf want some dip ,0
finally a gluten free bread that behaves like real bread it is soft and doesnot fall apart into crumbs like other gluten free breads tastes better too a winner in my book ,1
i have always been a big tea fan but i have never had a ginger honey tea before i tried this one i am glad i tried it because it is great it is the kind of tea you sip while reading a good book it was not overpowering which teas that have ginger sometimes can be and it was not too sweet either if you like tea you should give this one a shot it is tasty ,1
this tastes wonderful probably the best quick meal like this i have ever had great for lunch at work when you do not want to go out or just want an inexpensive delicious lunch i would say this is as good as some restaurants great product ,1
great product one of my favorite candies much better than the nerds i bought too too bad it has hydrogenated palm oils they are bad for you but it tastes so good i do not care i am an adult by the way i bought the watermelon bars with the candy seeds loved it i like grape and cherry too ,1
this is so delicious i bought a espresso machine so that i can start saving money from going to the coffee shop i make an espresso for me and coffe for my husband daily since i make per day my supply is really low i am so content and happy that i can go straight to work with my caffeine kick,1
cheaper and more accessible than going to starbucks this is the earl grey the best start for a long day ,1
i know this product tastes good because i mix it with salt and use it for gum issues the gums stay sore after using this mixture on them for about a week to a month but then they heal completely it takes daily use to get the gums to heal but they eventually do others have said mustard oil stinks i washed my hair and put some in my hair as usual and a co worker said you smell good we could not figureo out what it was but the only smell on me was the mustard oil finally i do not know if this is true or not but i think my hair is growing quicker i put a permanent dye on my hair two weeks ago and now i have to put some more on it dye normally does not grow out in two weeks on ethnic hair what i like about the oil even if the rest is the placebo effect is that on ethnic hair the oil absorbs in about a day and your hair does not feel oily but it is indeed moisturized ,1
my family got this for me over a month ago and i still love it i hold it between my front paws and chew away even in front of the tv not sure why it is always inside because i keep bringing it outside but whatever it tastes great and i love it love it love it ,1
i drink a lot of green tea and this was the first time i tie the lemongrass green tea i was sceptical at fist but the scent is very soothing ,1
the dog absolutely loved the bone she had issues getting at the stuffing in the middle but i believe she enjoyed the challenge ,1
i love this drink i saw it as an oddity at a local jamaican market it is uniquely delicious if you like peanut butter chocolate ice cream you will love this ,1
i love this beaba machine i used it every single day when we were making purees my son is now into the chunkier meals and i still use the steamer option to this day to make steamed apples and pears yes you can probably get the same effect with a traditional steamer basket pot hot water and blender but that is the beauty of this little machine it is all things in one which means less clean up too pros easy to use the beaba babycook is super easy to use the first couple tries i found myself having to think about each step measure water level pour water align basket align lid turn knob to steam but after a few times you completely get the hang of it liquid reserves so one of the best things i found about the beaba is that you can save the liquid from the steaming process and use it to mix in with other foods for example whenever i steam apples or pears i save the liquid that is collected on the bottom and mix it in with oatmeal for an apple pear oatmeal bowl this is something that i found i can not do with a traditonal steamer pot and blender any root vegetables i would discard the liquid mainly because of my fear of pesticides and such but everything else i would keep the liquid and mix it in with foods easy to clean the only things you have to clean are the steam basket blender pot and lids they are dishwasher safe too so it can not get any easier than that cons small basket you can only cook a small amount of food at any time i found that i could only fit around half a potato diced at a time this was not a big issue for me because it only takes around minutes for the steam to be done but there were times that i used the traditional steamer basket pot to steam whole potatoes at once for the freezer and used the beaba blender to puree stains the plastic material is a bit porous so you will see stains especially from carrots and beets the plastic steam basket will definitely stain mine is an orangey color from the carrots and sweet potatos expensive it is quite costly and it is really hard to find these on sale if you plan on using it for one kid i would reconsider if you plan on using it for more than one kid might be worth the investment overall i am very glad i made the purchase not only is it functional it looks super cute on your kitchen counter and makes the baby food making process that much more fun ,1
tart yes i guess it is tart like a lemonade might be but my entire family loves it it is very refreshing and i love that it has no artificial sweeteners ,1
the red paper wasps i have wanted nothing to do with it it did catch a few bees flys etc this is about the device i have tried with no luck ,0
i had these for the first time at costco of course i was hooked instantly and then was heartbroken when i discovered they were not easily found at our local grocery store i ordered these when they were on sale but honestly would have paid full price they are that good these popcorn chips are so satisfying because of the chip like texture i pack them in my kids lunch and do not that bad since they are low fat try these for those that like that salty sweet you will be a fan ,1
these cookies are healthier than their american counterparts that is for sure they are delicious and i suppose you can say that they are healthy it arrived without any breakage but it did not arrive very quickly i have prime and it arrived in more than a week ,1
i purchased this at whole foods as well but felt the need to comment since i depend on comments myself for purchases this is a great product and smells divine i use this mainly for eating and cooking purposes but will be trying it for lotion and deoderant good choice for a coconut oil ,1
i was afraid in buying food online but you guys give me confidence in doing now i can fell like buying at the store in peru thanks ,1
unless you are very gullible and easily conned into trying something new based on false advertising claims you will not even bother to try this fancy bottled water with black plant scum added to it listen so black water marketers have taken the sciencey angle to target the new age and organic folks and the alternative medicine subscribers all bases covered but wait they also appeal to real housewives jacqueline laurita on real housewives of new jersey says scientists called it fulvic acid the miracle molecule because it is so small she added that drinking blk water would make your hair nails and skin glow and could also help with hangovers wow i bet it cleans my car too what does not it do black water has a dark side for sure it is a gimmick once you learn the sales pitch used to market useless dietary supplements or overpriced overhyped food stuffs you can begin to understand sciencey market speak pretty easily there is much of it in the organic aisle of the supermarket i can not conclude that any of us needs fulvic humic acid supplements and there currently is no evidence i have found to support that the miracle fulvic acid does anything to benefit your health i would predict that the oddness of the black water products and the price combined with no observable benefits to the consumer will likely result in this fad fading away but give them a prize for their stylish sciencey black marketing ,0
this has been one of my guys favorites from the start and we are on the box in month started him on solids at months bpa is found in the lids of all jarred baby food due to the canning process this does mean it makes its way into the food itself yummy and safe fear not ,1
baronet has the best selection of pod flavors on amazon chocolate babka is definitely my favorite the price is reasonable for a good coffee and even better if you get the subscription ,1
at first i did not realize annie is offers gf bunnies and was delighted to discover them while browsing through gf foods on amazon they taste great and look just like the regular flour wheat snacks my kids are able to enjoy gf bunnies just like their friends regular wheat i just wished they have different packaging to distinguish flour wheat bunnies from gf bunnies it will makes shopping easier for sure ,1
this is not a bad deal it is slightly more bitter than rishi green tea powder but i added one packet of stevia it was delicious i only drink it iced for the price this is pretty good i will be buying again ,1
this is not a product i would ever order again extremely expensive and for the cost crackers are not what i was hoping for they are very very solid and hard to eat would have liked to have known that these are more than crisp they are brick hard anyone with dentures should not order these ,0
the house blend is an excellent roast definetly recommended decent price too consumer reports rated this number one recently ordered a few times from amazon always with good results ,1

in my house this coffee got very mixed reviews my brother in law liked it thumbs up he is a teenager and for some reason drinks his coffee black although when my husband put cream and sugar in it he liked it much better my mother in law gave it a mixed review she thought it was better than most flavored coffees the vanilla flavor is genuine instead of artificial my husband did not like it his complaint with flavored coffee is that the vanilla flavor stays with you long after the coffee is gone he agreed that this is better vanilla flavored coffee than any other he is had but it still would not be what he would choose personally i discovered that i am not a starbucks coffee person i love their iced coffee and drinks but not their coffee i prefer a mix of trader joe is columbian decaf and joe blend i did like the vanilla flavor though and if i were to choose a starbucks coffee it would be this one the verdict if you like flavored coffee you will love starbucks new version for ground coffee it is also surprisingly fresh tasting if you do not like flavored coffee then you probably still will not like this there is an aftertaste to it ,1
bounty rolled paper towels sre very absorbent when i have the money and they are on sale i prefer buying this brand over the others however that being said it is pricey and although i hate to buy the cheap stuff that sometimes falls apart when it is being used sometimes i have no other alternative anyway when i have the money i put my money on bounty paper towels i can get alot more done with these paper towels without them falling to pieces and they do not smell strange like solvent like some of the cheaper paper towels do ,1
i like to buy all sorts of hot sauces for all sorts of food but no other hot sauce gets chosen more than frank is i use it for pizza chicken all mexican and even breakfast foods i do not know of a hot sauce that tastes better everything is blended very well not too hot just a touch of vineger and a nice cayenne pepper taste best of all add frank is and some butter on the stove let it sizzle for minutes and you have great tasting wing sauce the only bad thing i can report on this sauce is if you find a very old bottle still on the shelves there could be a small chance of some clumping and flavor issues ,1

ok i admit it at first i just thought this was an energy drink and not a water enhancer drank some straight up thought it tasted nasty then took a peek at the reviews and realized you are supposed to only give a squirt to oz of water did that and it tasted less strong but still not pleasant i like fruit punch as a flavor but the taste of this leaves a lot to be desired the flavor of hawaiian punch is hugely better than this tried giving another squirt and it still tasted weak and unappealing i see it is got some vitamin c and b vitamins as well as caffeine in it and as has been mentioned by others this container is not easy to open i recently injured my right arm and that certainly did not help any you have to slice into the top a bit and then screw off the cap to find a seal that is quite hard to peel off like breaking into fort knox despite the flavor issues this might offer some kick and vitamins but who is going to drink it if it does not taste good almost brings gatorade to mind which i always found awful sorry this just did not work for me ,0
i prefer the taste of this soy drink on cereal in the morning it is the best in my opinion i use it in every recipe that calls for milk it does tend to make mashed potatoes taste like vanilla but i can live with that when my co ops stopped stocking this particular flavor brand i panicked but i found it on amazon and have been very happy especially since i order a couple of cases at a time amazon delivers this quickly and i have never had a problem with their service ,1

we just received july a shipment of the dark roast pods from amazon after not being able to get them for the last several months the site still says out of stock but i think if you place an order they will start catching up to demand in a little while many thanks to the person who wrote the review explaining the move of production facilities we tried a mr coffee keurig style machine while we were unable to get senseo but could not find any coffee as good as the douwe egberts pods we are very please to see the return of the senseo dark roast pods and i hope that my subscription for the french vanilla pods will also be available again soon ,1
my dogs great dane and english bull dog love this i will say that it is orange and after a good chewing we did see orange on the carpet but it came out with the normal stain remover if you have dogs i am sure you own a stain remover o they both have sensitive stomachs so we only let them have it for a little while and then gave it back to them the next day they seemed to be fine as for tartar this is an occasional treat so i am sure the effects would be better if this were an everyday thing ,1

i can not stand ginger i shy away from the pickled ginger at sushi restaurants and can not keep a potsticker down if it has a hint of ginger in it however i frequently experience motion sickness and digestive problems and i have always heard that ginger is a natural remedy for those things the first time i purchased ginger chews was out of necessity something to keep in my purse in case of emergency during a bumpy car ride or for after a greasy meal i was not crazy about them at first but they really do help with the nausea and are more pleasant than taking pepto every time i get indigestion needless to say they began growing on me and now i eat them just because i like them ,1

i bought two of these treat balls for two large breed dogs one my power chewer is a german shepherd wolf mix the other is a vizsla lab mix who is not easily impressed by chew toys i filled the inside of the ball with small treats and capped both ends with the round treats provided on the upside when they were actively chewing on the treat balls they were fully absorbed and were extremely happy with them in about an hour and a half both dogs had chewed the everlasting out of at least one side of each of their treat balls by three hours there were no treats left in either of them since the ball itself seems pretty flimsy i then took the balls away so they would not destroy those too the treats give off a nauseating smell as the dogs are chewing them as well to the point i had to turn on a fan and even left the room i would not recommend this product due to the high price tag and the fact that it just does not deliver on it is name ,0
my daughter is allergic to peanuts cashews and pistachios and she is also a picky fussy eater packing lunches for school was becoming a nightmare she finally got the clearance to eat almonds from her allergist but they had to come from an almond only facility easier said then done i was so happy to find this almond butter no chance of cross contamination of course my daughter was hesitant at first because she never really had any nut product but now she loves it great with nutella her favorite breakfast is toast with barney butter and bananas yummy ,1

i was very dubious that this stuff would be any good when i bought it but i just finished making the cheese biscuit recipe on the box and i am amazed seriously they are so good even my kids like them they could not tell they were low carb they were soft light and buttery like the cheddar biscuits at red lobster i would not recommend using the plain ol water and carbquick biscuit recipe even if you use real bisquick those biscuits are never going to be any good anyone who has made biscuits from scratch knows they have to have a lot of fat in them either butter or shortening to be edible and you have to stop messing with the dough as soon as everything is moist enough to stick together do not knead it at all or you will wind up with hocky pucks anyway follow the directions measure accurately and do not cut corners margarine yuck the recipe says to use butter so do not complain if you do not follow directions and you wind up with a mess i will be making the pancakes tomorrow can not wait it is been probably at least a year since i had pancakes btw a couple of reviews on here have been bad because it is too pricey but that is not really fair this price on amazon is more than twice the price i got mine for elsewhere that is not carbquick is fault as with anything you have to shop around ,1
i first bought this bread at whole foods and loved it then they had a problem with their supplier and week after week had no bread i checked on line and found that amazon had it at a price lower than whole foods so i bought a case packages and am now on my second case it is so delicious i love the chewy whole rye berries and the thin dense slices every morning i eat a slice with either peanut butter or a slice of good cheddar cheese one thing i love about it is that it has a shelf life of months or more this is because it is pasteurized after being packaged once opened it is fine for a week if your like whole grain breads try this you will love it ,1

for many years i used dried minced garlic in many dishes much preferring it to the powdered often salted type we used to be able to get it at a local big box store which unfortunately stopped carrying it i like not only the convenience but the taste this does not have any additives like most of the blends and most significantly does not have salt which many companies add because it is a preservative and adds cheap bulk i like being able to control what i add to recipes which means adding salt when i want it and not when i do not i use a lot of garlic in my cooking and usually have fresh on hand there are times when i actually prefer the dried it is a more concentrated flavor so if you are adding it to a sauce where it will absorb some of the liquid you can get a more intense flavor than you can with the fresh then there is the obvious advantage that it does not spoil as fast in fact i have never had it spoil and i live in a humid environment where things go off rather quickly when this disappeared from my local store in bulk i had to buy it in small spice jars for vastly more than this costs something on the order of the price what you get from amazon is an enormous amount given that it is typically sold in oz spice jars which i suspect would last most people a long long time i transferred one of the bags to a quart jar and after a month in the tropics it is still dry fresh this is something i like well enough that having used it i do not want to be without it and yes did pay over as much in the supermarket before i found it at amazon i hope this is something they continue to stock an item which i now consider a staple ,1

i never liked tomato sauce on my pasta until i tried this cherry tomato sauce it is naturally a little sweeter than most sauces is quite peppery and is as the other commenter noted very fresh tasting it tastes almost as good as making a slow cooked sauce yourself i am excited to find this sauce on amazon as my costco no longer carries it ,1

if you have never tried italian yoga juice you are missing out on something seriously spectacular i tried one of these in italy and drank nothing else for the entire trip in the states we have nothing that even remotely compares to yoga juice no juice has been able to satisfy the longing i feel for yoga i searched high and low trying to find an affordable way to have it shipped to me because sadly this juice cannot be purchased in the u s my last resort was to have my family over there ship it which would have been extremely expensive and unreliable then ditalia made my year offering three different flavors in two different sizes ditalia took great care in the packaging of these glass bottles to make sure that they arrived in tact i ordered my juice and a week and a half later they were waiting for me outside of my apartment i could not be happier bravo ditalia ,1
i feel really bad writing this review since i am a big fan of the newman is own brand for human food their salad dressings are amazing however my cat would not eat this product i purchased the beef flavor because she loves her beef flavored cat treats i give her organic dry food most of the time but after talking to some other cat owners they informed me that i should be mixing some wet food into her diet because wild cats get most of their moisture from their food in nature and do not drink a lot of water i thought it could not hurt to give this to the cat as a treat a couple times a week but she will not even touch it i tried mixing her regular dry food into it to give it some texture and she just ate the dry food around it i am not sure if this is just a textual preference for my cat or if it is this particular cat food ,0
my cat loves this food however she goes thru it like crazy and she is not a fatty just wish it were less pricey ,1
you know i was the person who recommended these capsules on the deal sites when they were half the price they are now at this is a complete rip off basically you get like a savings for a far inferior product to nespresso is own capsules yes these are biodegradable but you can bring nespresso capsules in to have them recycled too and any flavor of nespresso tastes better than these cremoso is a very weak i would only really use it for lattes and of course you would need at least two shots to taste anything resembling espresso i do not work for nespresso i wanted to get this out of the way because i myself was suspicious about the poor reviews of this product at first as mentioned i recommended this product on sites like fatwallet when it was half the price because some of us are broke and can not afford the far superior nespresso capsules i am really pissed off because i wasted my time directing thousands of consumers to the ethical capsules assuming that the capsules were going to continue to be sold at a price that would save people money why in the world would a company launch an inferior product at no savings to the consumer nespresso capsules produce great tasting coffee and nespresso is capsules are sealed until they are used unlike ethical is capsules once you break open ethical is bag of ten you pretty much have to use the capsules right away btw these take a long time to decompose in a composter so be sure you cover them for months if you do decide to waste your money on these finally while the capsules do work in my essenza it is a very tight fit and lately the essenza lever kind of pops up at the end of the extraction my essenza was two weeks old when i started using these i will amend this review if the company decides to do what is right that is not gouge consumers ,0
my dog just loves these chews and as a bonus they have a coating that is good for keeping her teeth clean and healthy these are composite product as opposed to a rawhide chew they do not splinter and do not make a big sloppy mess but they do have a pretty strong smell we give her one a day and if we forget she asks for it the price through amazon was about half what my vet charged ,1
i am one of the pickiest eaters on the planet and when i found these i could not put them down i bought them on a a trip down south at super target and when i returned i seriously went to every store looking for them with no success i wish it was available because i would buy them every week i think they are worth the hassle to order online even they are sweet with whole grains and will fill you up when you are on the go i can satisfy my sweet tooth without eating garbage i would not mush them up eating as cereal the best way is right out of the bag i am partial to the strawberry but the blueberry is worth the try too ,1
great packaging very well sealed store in a dark place i use this as an ingredient in my homemade seasoning that i use to sprinkle on foods before consumption and sometimes in the food itself i like the quality price and packaging ,1
gross tastes like salty menthol sugar or something might be passable if you are hiding it in something you are baking but for coffee nah if you do not own a dog use xylitol because xylitol will kill your dog if you do own a dog just be a man and either quit sweeteners all together or enjoy sugar unless you have diabetes the truth is that most of you will try this sweetener that sweetener and eventually end up back at sugar sugar crushes erythritol ,0
my husband remembered fizzies when we saw them on unwrapped i looked for them online found and ordered them fantastic we are having so much fun sharing them with the little ones in our lives he loves sharing a piece of his childhood and watching the excitement as the children discover the same joy he remembered parents enjoy the vitamin c as a bonus to the children fun thank youmelody,1
if you like sprouted flaxseed this product is outstanding it does not need any refrigeration and is sweet in taste and is delicious on your cereal ,1
first had these at nola restaurant in new orleans pre katrina as martini drinkers we like to occasionally have different garnishes when we tire of olives these are just great no fat low carb too ,1
this product is easy to use has more flavor than the plain bisquick and makes very light biscuits can mix it up in a minute or two and have it ready to eat quickly freshness retains in baked product longer than with regular bisquick ,1
typically this product can be found at most local grocery stores it is mainly used to make hispanic dishes such as tamales tortillas etc the flour is expensive here on amazon normally it cost is about at most grocery store is max the flour is gluten free so for people who care cautiously watching the ingredients this is a relief ,1
i buy of these at least twice a month and i use the coconut oil for everything i have been losing weight and my skin has never been better i never had a problem with the oil leaking out of the packaging and is very disappointed amazon will no longer carry this item amazon had the best deal on this item anywhere i will pray that they find a way to bring it back more people should research the amazing benefits of using this oil stars ,1
i buy this amazing tea by the amazon case and am sure to have it in the house at all times for a truly decadent and easy chai mix up a tall mug of big train then add a bengal spice tea bag wait minutes as you savor the steam if this is not what heaven smells like then god is not perfect yes it is as delicious as its aroma ,1
these nibs are not quite the equal of the higher price ones i will use them up but will not buy this kind again they do not have the intense flavor of scharfenberger ,0
i was glad to find this tea as for some reason my local stores quit carrying this flavor came with a great price and now im stocked up only issue is that the box it came in looked like it had been thrown from a plane at feet i know this is more of a ups error though so no stars deducted for that ,1
i like the flavor of these cookies and crisp is certainly an appropriate word to describe them the thing is people who are looking for a sweet cookie are probably going to be disappointed people who like things that are not extremely sweet but still flavorful and a bit sweet will i am not sure what is with the newton label since the only thing it has in common with a fig newton is the name but they are still enjoyable on a side note i like the package the cookies come in too keeps them fresh and easily closed again ,1
if you want great coffee not that strong thick stuff this is the coffee i served this to friends and they loved the mellow chocolate flavor and smooth coffee experience so much they were asking what kind i buy and where originally i purchased this in a sam is club in michigan but i live in chicago so i thought i would get online and see if i could buy it now i plan on buying only this brand for as long as i can get it try the hazelnut and traverse city cherry flavors too so good without the flavor being over whelming the coffee still comes through serious coffee for serious coffee lovers ,1
from canada originally so i have drank a lot of tea since i was a kid i remember putting carnation milk in my tea which i think my grandmother started me on sugar too well do not use any sweeteners now and only skim to lighten it up this stuff tastes real good i did receive one of the box of with some loose tea between the box and cellophane wrap not big deal i thought until i opened the box i ended up with only about tea bags out of the that were not completely sealed bags so not sure why that had happened to most of the bags the other boxes do not appear to have any loose tea on the outside ,1
we drink a lot of crystal light as a break from soft drinks we thought we would try their new mocktail flavors and give them a chance this margarita flavor is not bad it actually tastes like a margarita with a couple of good exceptions no sugar low sodium and it has only calories for ounces each canister has plastic pouches and each pouch makes quarts mix it up and serve it cold with ice or refrigerate for the best flavor crystal light is a good low calorie drink and the broad flavor mix helps keep them tasting good we found this margarita taste to be better than the appletini flavor i still like some of the original crystal light flavors more but this is good for a change it tastes as good as some other more expensive margarita mixes i looked at a bottle of one of the famous brands that has calories for ounces and sugars that is a huge difference try it you will like it ,1
all i can say is this is an excellent buy and good crackers worth every penny ,1
i have yet to have one cup of this coffee brew properly always leaves grounds in the cup an about have of the time the thing blocks the coffer maker and blows grounds all over the coffee maker and counter this is the only brand i have had this problem with and threw away about k cups rather than clean the mess ,0
at the rec would microwave time though unless you move them to another bowl or plate they took for ever to cool nice flavor purchase at costco for much cheaper if you can ,1
i have nothing but great things to say about yummy spoonfuls i have purchased the creamy variety pack several times and am now purchasing the mushy stage foods in our area it is very hard to find fresh frozen organic baby food i really wish i had the time and knowledge to make my own food but i do not and i truly feel yummy spoonfuls is the next best option to making your own food my baby has done very well with their food and i feel like i am offering healthier choices for my baby i have tasted everything that i have given my baby and everything tastes great at first i was discouraged because i was going to order directly through yummy spoonfuls site and the cost to ship to california was extremely expensive then i saw on amazon and although the cost for the food is significantly higher you can get free shipping which brings the cost to about a container i have no problem paying a container for frozen healthy organic baby food versus for jarred food once you compare you will never want to feed your baby jarred food again also yummy spoonfuls is flexible and willing to work with their customers when i place an order for a variety pack i send them an email with the flavors that i want so you do not have to go with the flavors that typically come in the variety pack you have to choose at least of the same flavor bottomline i highly recommend this product ,1
i use this product strictly as a hair oil in small quantities as a hair oil in african american hair once again in small quantities it works wonders yes it has a coconut smell but it is a nice smell if you use it sparingly i had two ounce jars and it lasted for months i will definitely be buying more of this it made my hair much softer and smoother too ,1
love these sweet salty bars unfortunately they are addictive but we limit ourselves to only one a day better than other brands we have them on auto ship with amazon ,1
while these taste good they are far too messy i am consistently challenged by them in attempting to avoid both getting crumbling granola all over my desk and floor and having the chocolate melt all over my fingers i have had granola bars my whole life and i am well aware of the crumbs they can generate but these bars will send granola flying just by opening the wrapper and the chocolate on these bars melts instantly upon any bodily contact like fingers i bought these as a snack of convenience which they most definitely are not ,0
just got these in the mail and they are not precooked nor are they freeze dried they are just regular dried lentils amazon refunded my purchase price ,0
when i first received my order i was a little disappointed with the barley size they all kind of small but after i cooked it the size actually does not matter i ususlly make barley soup or mix with rice it is good for making risotto too when i cook it with rice i take of rice of barley and use water for cooking of rice set my rice cooker for at least hours timer the taste is great and i love the texture of barley my kids will eat this rice mix without complain it gives you a lot more fiber compares with just eating rice i keep my barley in freezer ,1

this is my favorite coconut water having traveled in asia and being able to get someone to climb a tree to harvest a coconut and then open it with a machete nothing i found in the store came close until i found taste nirvana the other brands are mostly from brazilian coconuts whereas this brand uses thailand coconuts and it makes a difference truly happiness in a bottle it is a little pricey but i can not get enough ,1
we have been eating and serving this dish for many years some of our favorite pair withs are fajitas with chicken or pork kabobs and we also love it with plain yogart every time we serve it everyone asks for the recipe because there is such a mixture of ingredients people assume it s home made we use a bit of olive oil instead of shortening and sprinkle a bit of fresh parsley on top enjoy and impress your guests ,1

as someone who develops his own starters i have learned about patience and failure no such worries here within hours starter was bubbling away with a strong sour nose to it at the same time as i began this i also started other commercial dried starters both are days away from being ready if just starting out or can not wait a week for a starter i highly recommend this live one ,1
the sour patch kids i bought recently are larger softer and taste differently than the ones i ordered in the past they are not sour and the bags are missing the loose sour powder they taste like a cheap knock off of the sour patch kids that you buy in the smaller bags in the grocery store i am not sure if i will buy them again but i can not recommend them ,0
i have been looking for a suitable substitute for fortified oat flakes produced the the famous p cereal company for like or years i loved those darned oat flakes well i have found it after trying dozens of oat flake cereals generic organic store brands etc do you know how hard it is to find an oat flake cereal that does not have honey nuts dried fruit or other stuff in it this cereal by arrowhead mills has the right flavor and the right crunch the only drawback is that they get soggy pretty fast i tend to put a thin layer in the bowl with a bit of milk and eat fast but the flavor the real flavor is soooo worth it thank you arrowhead mills for giving me back a happy piece of my childhood ,1
this is a nice lightly flavored not too sweet coffee the caramel vanilla cream also green mountain also in a k cup is definitely rounder in flavor and stronger on the vanilla notes but this is a pleasant nice coffee not too strong ,1
i was quite surprised with the tast and texture of this product it reminded me of light and crispy cinnamon toast crunch i would not have even known they were healty if i had not already before i tried them i did not think they had any of the good for you taste associated with most protien enhansed foods ,1
i have no complaints although i did not give it stars because the kind iused to buy had little bits of coconut in the oil in other words it seems like ithas been somewhat refined ,1

 dave is insanity sauce is top shelf when it comes to hot sauces this is for people who really like their mouth to catch on fire and for their chili to melt the pot this collection has four sauces the original insanity sauce which was once the hottest sauce available on the market made directly from capsaicin extract clocks in at a healthy scoville units the temporary insanity sauce which is as hot as the original but does not linger on the tongue the total insanity sauce is a garlicky version of the insanity sauce and finally the ultimate insanity sauce which gives you a mind numbing scoville units compare these to the average scoville units for your standard bottle of tabasco sauce and you can start to get the picture these are some true hot hot sauces the ultimate insanity sauce should get ladled out by the toothpick full rather than poured directly into a dish this is a great set for the price and you are not going to run out any time soon one bottle of any of these sauces will keep your mouth on fire for several years due to the small amounts used for each dish it is an awesome set and one that i highly recommend ,1

i am extremely sensitive to msg sulfites etc they give me terrible migraines although this mix says no msg it does contain sulfites so if a glass or two of wine gives you a headache wine typically contains sulfites then this pickling spice may give you migraines headaches as well this is just an fyi to the folks like me who have to be careful what they eat and drink the sulfites in this pickling blend are used a preservative which is completely unnecessary in my opinion mccormick simply wishes to ensure an indefinite shelf life for this stuff at the expense of individuals health ps i love to make pickles jellies and preserves etc and to give them as gifts if you give gifts of pickles made from this spice please consider warning the recipients about the sulfites nothing ruins a gift like associating a friend or loved one with a gift that makes you ill i speak from experience ,0
after having to give up coffee i have been trying many coffee replacements such as this kaffree roma this drink was pretty good a little like coffee but with more of a sesame type flavor other pros are that is a great value for the price and being instant it was fasy easy to prepare that being said i only gave it stars instead of as i have found a similar product called teeccino to have a more coffee like flavor and aroma ,1

its spaghetti so i do not know how you can screw it up but it was really good cooked up well on my campfire grill didnt stick together and the taste was really good i liked this just fine and will order more if i need to ,1
this nature is path love crunch organic granola is healthy and tastes great you could mix it in with plain greek yogurt for a protein filled power snack or you can just enjoy it as we did plain out of the bag each cup is calories and contains grams of sugar so try not to get too carried away you could do some serious damage to the bag in one sitting it is that tasty the only reason i did not give stars is because the amount of dark chocolate and red berries in the bag is actually very small you have to dig around for them if you buy this granola be prepared for the lack of these treats ,1
several of the cookies in the box were broken and there were quite a few crumbs in the bottom of the box i tried a cookie and it tastes just like a maria biscuit it could definitely have used a little less sugar for young children many of the cookies are hollow and when you break it in half it falls apart they are too fragile to put in a ziplock bag in a purse or so it would turn into crumbles right away i am not sure why they are called biter biscuits since it does give much of a workout for teethers either i find the banana cookies from gerber graduates a much better choice denser less messy and does not crumble ,0
lately i have been suffering from dry scalp and have purchased several expensive shampoos including some prescribed by my dermatologist to remedy it while i would not dare compare this product to some of those i did find that this one was an inexpensive alternative what i liked about this product while i have found that some of the other dry scalp products leave your hair feeling a bit dry leaving you with the need to lock in moisture this one did leave your hair feeling soft this product was also moisturizing with a pleasant smell although when you are lathering with it it smells tropically like coconuts with a hint of almond once rinsed i really did not notice a strong lingering odor this shampoo moisturizes your hair while nourishing it leaving your hair feeling clean and healthy the packaging is attractive and fits nicely in a corner of the shower or bath the bottle has a tall with a simple slender design and finally it is affordable overall i give this product a,1

i ordered this because i once bought great teabags called two leaves and a bud that came in a triangular shaped teabag and were very good these are not that i am not sure if the manufacturer has downgraded their quality or what but here are problems with these that i did not have when i originally bought from this company a year ago the teabags are packed together more tightly now and are squished into small plastic packages you are supposed to expand the teabag into it is original shape afterwards this does not work as well as the original packaging but the bigger problem is that the bit of paper on the end of the teabag string does this have a name is glued actually stuck in each individual package to the teabag portion try as you might to detach it so you can put only the bag and not the paper into your tea it will rip the bag and then tea leaves will leak out i should call it tea dust becuase tea leaves are what they used tohave but squished into thier new package they are just and expensive version of any other organic camomile tea they are no longer the cool unique ones that had really quality tea in them i am a pretty picky person about my tea but i am very dissapointed overall as this is not what i remember or expected about the quality of this tea ,0
a few months ago i discovered mentos gum and loved the way the gum had a very long lasting chewability the first flavors i tried were watermelon and red fruit after some online searching i found that there were a number of different flavors so i ordered some of each flavor so i could have my own little taste test after all of the sampling sweet mint emerged as my absolute favorite it has just a little bit of a mint bite and proved to be very enjoyable a lot of the mint gums just completely overpower you when you start chewing on them i now order the sweet mint flavor by the box so i can always have a good supply on hand watermelon anod red fruit are still on hand too just not in the quantity ,1

generally speaking i am a big fan of chocolate but not of coconut unless it is milk but this blend of the two made for an especially satisfying treat especially after a long aerobic workout it is a good sinful treat that can be enjoyed anytime whether it is while watching one is favorite episode of psych or as a reward for finishing that extra mile when jogging two of these treats were knocked off that way i had one of these treats with my lunch at that time i found they tasted even better when chilled as the one i ate with lunch was in my lunch bag in the fridge the bars have good texture and consistency either at room temperature or chilled and are quite filling especially with water i gave a couple to two of my acquaintances and they both raved about the treat also the one i brought to work and left casually on my desk mysteriously disappeared perhaps it grew legs and walked off in the interests of minimizing workplace theft i strongly suggest you keep these treats under lock and key ,1

i admit red beans and rice is one of my favorite things to eat and this little mix produces a perfect version a huge plus is that the mix is both economical and simple to prepare fixing perfect red beans and rice is as simple as boiling water with a little oil adding the mix and letting it simmer for twenty five minutes then voila perfect yummy delicious mouth watering food straight from the bayou country although perfect by itself there are so many ways to jazz this simple but yummy fare up add sauce piquant hot sauce or throw in sausage a big hit last sunday with my dinner guests or throw in diced tomates chicken pork beef shrimp whatever left overs you have in the fridge it does not really matter as most things taste better mixed in with red beans and rice so it tastes great is easy to prepare it is dirt cheap and can make you look like a culinary genius to your friends five stars all the way there are different brands out there including goya zatarins lipton vigo zatarains etc but i think you can always safely buy the less expensive version without sacrificing any quality but maybe you should sample the different mixes yourself and draw your own conclusions i cover my red beans and rice with lots of hot sauce so i may be covering up some sins if i had to pick though i generally get vigo is if it is available it is the one i am most used to ,1

i really like the taste of these energy chews i like eating them before a race i have a hard time eating them while running because they are slow to dissolve which is really nice for casual eating but not while trying to get a quick energy burst chewing while running does not work well because the chew breaks into small pieces making it dangerous for aspiration make those two problems better and this would get a star rating ,1
i get these at the supermarket once in a while i am not a big meat eater so this works out well for me i like to smother them with mustard trying different kinds to help keep it interesting i could proably eat a whole can in one sittinbg as long as i had plenty of milk and mustard,1

ok you pay for what you get but in this case you get quite a bargain i have compared this green tea to some of the other major brands honestly it is the same taste as the others and you get bags this will last me for the rest of the year because i drink green tea once a day i sometimes like to make my tea english style and mix the tea drop of skim milk or almond milk and a dab of honey gets rid of the bitter taste of which all green tea has pick this one up it is good ,1

i really enjoy flavored coffees so when we opened the pod sample pack that came with our new keurig machine i was excited to find a sample k cup of van houtte is french vanilla it ended up being one of the best flavors we had an opportunity to try van houtte is french vanilla is not quite as good as some of the french vanilla coffees i have had fresh brewed at local coffee shops but it is not too far off either it is a very mild but flavorful coffee with a smooth finish and no bitter aftertaste i do not like extra dark coffees with lots of acidity so of that is more your cup of tea so to speak this blend is not for you i will definitely be picking up more of this blend and if you are in the market for a french vanilla flavored coffee k up for your keurig brewer this one is an excellent choice ,1
my experience with the club soda was outstanding i loved the size of the bottles and although i only purchased a it was a delightful change from the regular brands of club soda that are always on the shelf wish i had bought more no broken bottles here ,1
i am not sure what the other reviewers expected when they ordered an unsweeted bottle of tea but the taste is exactly what you would get if you brewed a cup of tea at home use a bit of sweetener sugar or substitute if you do not care for unsweetened tea but do not bash the product because it does not taste like pepsi anteadote is a very convenient way to get tea into my daily routine i always keep a few bottles at work in case i forget to drink a bit in the morning i have never ordered from amazon before but i will now that they offer free shipping with amazon prime i have purchased other products from adagio including loose leaf tea and their teapot and i have always been very very satisfied love anteadote ,1

ginger has many proven and documented health benefits i first tried these when i had an upset stomach and could not find ginger ale or pink junk to help not only did they help they also taste great i then had to order the giant box of them to always ensure i have a supply also turns out my american bulldog loves them and it helps reduce his gas and saves my sense of smell and appetite as well as acts like n anti inflammatory when he gets sore the flavor is refreshing in almost any condition it is what i turn to for almost any and everything if i am nauseous it helps quell that if i am tired keeps me awake ,1

when i was first diagnosed with celiac disease gluten intolerance i was surprised at how many cereals contained food additives or other items that i could not eat even if i ignored the cereals that were made directly from wheat barley oats rye the things i cannot eat there were still many other cereals based on soy rice or corn maize that had barley malt in as a flavoring so i could not eat them i tried many cereals until i found this one and i have had this as my mainstay ever since it is tasty has an excellent texture and i am sure anyone would like it you would not need to be on a special diet to enjoy this as a breakfast dish ,1
i like these at for bottles the only drawback on subscribe and save is that they adjust the price with out letting me know but as long as you monitor what it costs there are some pretty good deals ,1

mmmmmm recently tried the deluxe bar after trying all the other flavors and so far it is my favorite thus far the deluxe bars have been delicate and crumbly like halvah ought to be though i have only had a few bars there is a possibility that i may come across one with that unpleasant cardboard texture i have had this experience with the chocolate flavored bar i did squeeze several of the unopened deluxe bars and they felt soft and crumbly mmmmm i have high hopes for this bar and have a feeling that i may have hit the jackpot on this flavor wish me luck it would be nice if all the ingredients were listed here on amazon although had i known what the other ingredients are i might not have ordered this flavor besides sesame seeds sweetener etc there are raisins pumpkin seeds almonds sunflower seeds cashews and pistachios but i have to date only noticed almonds most of the other ingredients may be very well ground into the mixture or maybe i have not eaten a bar with noticeable pieces of the other ingredients after placing my order i read the ingredients on the camel is web site and my mind thought oh no big chunks of raisins nuts and seeds will ruin my halvah eating rapture not so i am delighted ,1
i have used this product for about a month now and it is as advertised cooking with coconut oil gives a nice flavor to eggs or other items and it can be used on bread to replace butter etc ,1
i am not what i would consider to be a spiced tea kind of person in fact until just recently i have always been more of a simple plain tea drinker ie green tea red tea lipton tea etc however as i was meandering down the aisles of sam is club a few weeks ago during their sample hand outs i was handed a cup of this strange yet inviting intoxicating smelling drink did not think i would like it but tried it anyways to my surprise it was not only delicious but by the next day i was addicted to it everything about this tea is wonderful the smell the taste just the right amount of sweetness and spices comforting like hot chocolate yet made with spices you would find in a pumpkin pie more like a frothy elixer than tea delicious hopefully they never stop selling this chai tea because i plan to always have some on hand and will be drinking it for the rest of my life hopefully it is a tradition i can pass down to my child and eventually to her children ,1
so at first glance these just look like any other olive stuffed with pimento but they are not both the olives and the peppers used are unique varietals and they go together beautifully i thought the buttery description was just ad copy when i first got them but something about this olive variety really is more hearty and buttery than the typical martini olive and the peppers use have a more vibrant sweet character than pimento that really pops and complements the olive they are easily my favorite olive and furthermore the only brand i have tried that stands out among martini olives the only problem with them is that i snack on them too much so they never last even worse the only local store that carries them always runs out of the pepper variety almost immediately so they are never in stock the citrus ones are tasty too but the flavors do not complement each other as well so you really want these ones in particular so let is put it this way i am on amazon today because i am willing to pay a premium per jar to get these olives shipped to me that is how good they are ,1
i have older dogs that are both on meds pill pockets are the only way i can get them to take their pills without a fight no more chasing them and forcing their mouths open to push the pill down their throats now i just hand them their pill pockets and the are happy and so am i ,1
i have purchased the turkey stuffing compleats from amazon and enjoy that kind very much have purchased several times and sent some to family members i bought this chick gravy mash from walmart website for each they offer a few varieties and i thought it was best to just order or to see if i like it rather than be stuck with by ordering here i am glad i only ordered the i ate was horrible it was kinda like the texture and taste of warm paste if you can imagine that the chicken breast looked good and all white meat but it was tasteless other than the pasty taste and texture of the gravy and mashed potatoes i think i would only eat this again if i was starving i can not in good conscience recommend it ,0

if you like your hot sauce fiery hot and tasty you should do yourself a favor and buy marie sharp is it has a carrot base which is why it is orange but all of the other ingredients onion garlic select habanero peppers etc are fresh and go well with the base which you do not taste the preservative is natural vinegar which gives it a little hint of tabasco flavor except this is actually you know hot ,1

before joining the military back about about a bazillion years ago i was not a coffee drinker never cared for the stuff as fate would have it my first duty station was in germany and required many long shifts at odd hours i begrudgingly began to drink the stuff and surly everyone has heard about military coffee all of it is true by accident i happened across jacobs coffee and began to drink the stuff for pure enjoyment drank it by the pot i did loved the stuff and then i rotated back to the states this was before the days of the luxury of the internet and my beloved coffee was not to be found after i went overseas again and managed to bring back some arabic coffee but it was a poor substitute and then i found amazon com love this site and the things i can find on it i am reviewing this purchase not for the coffee which by now i think i have gotten the point across that i love to death but rather the grate deal i got on it ,1
my cats love this stuff they know what the bottle looks like now and the second that they see it the first thing that they do is jump on their cat house and wait for the fun to start,1
as a new cl convert i have taken it upon myself to sample all of the different flavors i can on my latest grocery outing i discovered this little gem it is cherry pomegranate with extra stuff added to it for immunity defense boosting reasons flavor wise it is a ok it does not taste as natural as some of the other flavors but it is still tasty by natural i mean it tastes more like a kool aid type of flavor which should not be construed as a negative thing nothing but love for kool aid in my house this would be a great flavor to give to children on hot summer days especially children who are prone to summer colds the only negative side is the coloring it is a lovely reddish color very deep rich looking i actually thought to recommend it to some of my vampire role playing friends it is just very easy to stain clothing furniture clothing with i recommend a degree of caution when drinking this in anything that can not be bleached still give this a chance yummy good for you ,1
i thanks tully is kona coffee its very flavorful thanks for the opertunity to buy this product on amazon com great price too rhanks so much ,1

i purchased this grinder a little over months ago from the mercantile station thru amazon since that time have we run over lbs of meat through it as my wife and i do not purchase hamburger from the stores anymore as we like to know what is inside our hamburger mix we are also grinding up meat into hamburger for our relatives so this grinder is get a lot of good hard use we had a smaller kitchen grinder for a couple of years before we purchased this one but it was a much smaller size and it kept bogging down and our meat kept getting caught in the front of the grinder this is why we decided to purchase a larger grinder with more power the magnum we found out is what is considered a size grinder and not a size or like most smaller kitchen grinders and this larger output of meat made our job of grinding much faster in fact we have been grinding lbs of meat at a time and freezing it into lb bags we double grind our meat with the largest grinding plate first and then follow up with the smallest plate for the second grind as this helps us mix the fat a lot easier ok the pros of the fast powerful hawg grinder lbs of meat double ground takes us around to the grinder body itself is cast stainless steel easy to the parts of the grinding head are cast aluminum also easy to clean no dishwashers stainless steel cutting blades excellent so we can match them up with the grinding very good instructions which also included tips on grinding sausage stuffing tomato juicer attachment nice extra but we have not tried this one yet now the cons of the grinder none so far we will be grinding much more meat in the future and if i come up with any extra information on the pros and cons of this product i will add them to this review as time goes on but for now we could not be happier i can sincerely tell you if you are looking to purchase a fast and very powerful meat grinder i would highly suggest that you buy one of these and i do not think you will be disappointed at all ,1
you can use fat free cream cheese fat free whipped topping and omit the butter and it is still wonderful it is so good that way i have not even tried it as a cheeseball you can do the same with all of the wind willow mixes i have tried some of the mixes do not suggest making a pie but many of them are still good to use as a pie mix i would give it a star but i frequently find the graham cracker topping is stale i recommend testing it before you put it on the pie i routinely toss the topping amazon is price is better that the only store carrying the product in my area so that mean is it is going to be on the shelf longer due to the quantity i have not had a problem with the rest of the mix going bad ,1
like the other clear brand conditioners i have tried this one is lightly scented and i would have to say that i like the scent i am not sure exactly what the scent is but it is pleasant the consistency of the conditioner is okay but i prefer thicker conditioners it rinses out well enough and leaves my hair soft i like that the spout is on the bottom because this helps the conditioner settle and makes it easier to get the last bit of conditioner out of the bottle ,1
this is the best gluten free bread mix i have found it is tasty soft and has nice texture i have tried many other gluten free breads both mixes and baked only one that comes close is kinnick but at twice the cost ,1
my cat loves this food i did a lot of research before choosing my cat is food for obvious reasons he is my pet i am responsible for what he eats and i want him to be as healthy as he can possibly be my cat is on the following eating program and i swear he looks like he is on steroids except in a very lean and healthy way he does not overeat so i always keep wellness complete health dry food in his bowl and he just snacks on it from time to time throughout the day every morning he gets a small can of the wellness canned food i switch up the flavors but his favorite is the salmon beef sometimes he eats most of it in one sitting sometimes he eats it throughout the day for snacks he gets whole life brand freeze dried chicken or salmon sometimes dry sometimes i run hot water over the chunks i recommend this program to anyone who loves their cat my cat is an indoor outdoor cat and he is in extremely good shape he seems sharp and alert his coat is incredibly shiny and silky and he just looks very very healthy and happy i attribute most of this to his diet the best cat food on the market ,1
first off i have to say this is the best value i have found on evco i really did not know how big this container would be until it arrived but the way we go through it i might divide it into smaller containers and start keeping them in different places instead of always running to the kitchen the oil looks and smells fresh and creamy but maybe i am just getting more used to coconut oil or maybe this batch does not have as much of that cocoa smell not that that is a bad thing i would just say it seems more neutral especially after cooking with it i have to say that since i have been using this product i have really lost my cravings and appetite is much less i am a stay at home mom and think about food weight all day adding the oil to my everyday cooking has made it easier for me to start cutting out more carbs and have the energy to get back into doing exercise videos a couple times a week in about weeks i have lost almost pounds and it has all come off my waist and belly too excited is an understatement good fats make all the difference avoid those hydrogenated ones and you will be amazed i feel more relaxed and confident now that the weight really will come off permanently in time without all the fuss of counting calories fat blah blah love it ,1
i am a tea drinker from way back and stash is an excellent tea this flavor has a smooth strawberry pomegranate taste and is delicious it is a red tea red in colour and red because its primary ingredient is rooibos which is red tea and is slightly sweet also included in this order are rosehips hibiscus flowers raspberry leaves citric acid and strawberry flavour and pomegranate flavour i did some research on the health benefits of some of these ingredients this info is what i found reported in a few different sources rooibus tea rooibus tea is rich in antioxidants and flavonoids and is reported to have times more antioxidant power than green tea it also has other antioxidants not found in other teas the effect of free radicals in the process of aging and declining of the immune system is limited by the antioxidants in rooibus tea rooibus tea is completely pure and natural it contains no additives preservatives or colorant it is strongly recommended for those suffering from irritability headaches disturbed sleeping patterns insomnia nervous tension mild depression or hypertension it has no caffeine and so has a soothing effect on the central nervous system rooibus tea is low in tannin and so it does not have a negative effect on the absorption of iron and proteins into the body it has anti spasmodic properties thus relieving stomach cramps and colic in infants it also relieves stomach and indigestive problems like nausea vomiting hearrtburn stomach ulcers and constipation it supplements the daily amounts of calcium manganese and flouride and it contains zinc and alpha hydroxy acid i was also told that red tea does not have ecog a healthful property that green tea does have that is why i drink both red tea and green tea to get the best of all worlds rosehips is supposed to be good for infections bladder problems and diarrhea and also a good source of vitamin c hibiscus flowers is supposed to be a diuretic fluid release and reported to help lower high blood pressure in people with type diabetes if i had only two words to describe the taste of this tea they would be fruity and smooth it is also caffeine free it is a nice change of pace from standard flavors and a nice after dinner comfort drink stash makes a good full bodied tea stronger than some of these cheapie teas so i find i only need one bag per a oz cup of course that all depends on your preference these special stash flavors are a little hard to find because many stores do not carry them unless they have a super large tea display btw i am not a doctor my disclaimer just someone who has done a lot of reading on alternative health care as with any product consult your health cae provider especially if you are on medications ,1
this tea is the most amazing full flavored tea ever if you love cinnamon sugar then you will be satisfied with this it is sweet so no sugar needs to be added and has a nice spice to it as well enjoy ,1

personally i think the good reviews are from someone vested in this company i have several it is from concentrate not in natural form and it tastes like it is in plastic bottles and it takes like the more of a saltier taste than all other brands i have tasted and i drink coconut water every the only one worse than this one is the zico brand also from concentrate do not buy it ,0
i was very happy to find one of my childhood favorite candy bars marathon bars still being produced in a narrower form as the curly wurly they are braided caramel smothered in chocolate and they are brilliant ,1
these dense moist bars made mostly of date paste are not pretty but they offer a relatively healthy alternative as an on the go meal supplement or breakfast the bars are chewy with a bit of seed crunch from black and white chia seeds they taste more of dates than strawberries strawberry puree is fourth on the ingredient list after date paste rolled oats and brown rice syrup the cloying sweetness of dates simply overwhelms the berry flavor although the strawberry taste and scent are there for me that is not a bad thing i like dates but people expecting a fresh dominant strawberry taste will be disappointed the cashews cannot be easily detected in the flavor either although they add to the protein with grams of sugar the bars are not a good choice for people trying to limit sugar intake although the modest grams of fat no saturated or trans fat works for those who are on fat restricted diets the primary nutritional benefit of the fruition bars comes from the fiber grams and protein grams with antioxidants from the fruit nuts and whole grain oats they contain no vitamins and only a small amount of minerals rda of calcium and rda of iron in fact the complete absence of vitamin c suggests just how few strawberries each bar contains because these are vegan they contain no dairy products no eggs no milk no butter no whey they are the organic counterpart of the usual meal and sports bars both in taste and texture if you do not like dense and chewy sports bars you will not like these but if you do and like the taste of dates try these out debbie lee wesselmann,1
i like the do it yourself squeeze concept for a few reasons first you control how much you want to put in i personally like my drinks not too sweet so i will only use a little and depending on how much energy you want you can control that as well and if you figure out how many drinks you can make with this bottle it is very cost effective ,1

i expected this to be a creamy taco topper a bit spicy a bit tangy and a bit like ranch i was not sure i would like it so i did not put it directly on my taco i put a puddle of this sauce on the side of my plate and thank god that is all i did this was in a word disgusting it was so bad in fact that after my first taste of it i went back in the kitchen and wiped it off my plate i did not want to look at it i did not want to smell it i did not want it anywhere near me my dinner companions hated it just as much you know what came to mind harry potter you know those jelly beans harry potter eats in the first or second book the flavor of this sauce makes me think of the earwax jelly bean or the vomit one it is just that bad i absolutely love taco bell is restaurant sauce it is a shame i did not like this as well ,0
this teriyaki sauce is great italian dressing but terrible teriyaki sauce if you are looking for a gluten free version of teriyaki sauce look elsewhere because whatever this is it is not teriyaki ,0
in my opinion this is the best coffee that timothy is have produced and offered i like it is taste and smell and would recommend it to coffee drinkers who prefer unflavoured coffee ,1
if the recipe absolutely calls for corn syrup use corn syrup but if it does not you may want to try using this instead ,1
not sure if this was supposed to mimic mt dew or not in any case it does have a nice flavor and is really quite good as long as you are not expecting dew this stuff is gonna satisfy really tasty ,1
the price currently on amazon is a bit higher than i am used to spending at my local asian market but i would not hesitate to buy it if i could not get it locally this chinese style green tea is not very bitter as green tea can be and has a pleasing taste being certified organic is a big plus and one of the reasons i keep buying this brand ,1
the pomegranate flavor in this tea makes it a winner it has that little bit of extra something that you just need sometimes when you drink a lot of tea something different a different flavor if you like to eat pomegranates you will like this if you are not a fan of the fruit you probably will not be a fan of this tea it has that little bit of zing that the fruit has and it is just perfect to drink while watching the sunrise ,1
i have enjoyed this mio sweet tea it is easier to add to your water than the individual powdered drinks that always seem to end up with powder everywhere squirting the concentrated flavor takes a little practice my first glass was way too strong but it has a good sweet tea flavor this would be great to drop in your purse the plastic snap lid will not leak i like the idea behind this and would be interested in trying other flavors to see if they are as good as the sweet tea one ,1
i would not purchase this product again the order i received was manufactured in and i am sure this affects the potency i get no energy boost at all too bad i bought pack because i thought it was a great deal ,0
i absolutely love these cookies they are great for dunking they absorb a lot of milk when completely submerged great chocolate taste with a hint of coconut they remind me of the samoa girl scout cookies except they are less decadent and dunkable ,1
i have never loved tea without a pile of sugar and cream until this one i am addicted and pace nervously when my tin runs low order the pack you will not regret it ,1
the product was exactly what i asked for the only thing is that they could have packaged it better they just put it in a bag and sent it instead of a sturdy box ,1
i rate this product a because if there is no walmart near you it is very difficult to find the taste is almost as good as the regular but not quite as sweet i am looking for it all the time ,1
this cereal is some kind of awesome i usually eat honey bunches of oats with almonds and this is every bit as good and maybe a little better it is basically corn flakes coated in honey with chopped nuts does not sound thrilling but it has a great flavor it stays crispy in milk only for a few minutes before getting a little soggy but i prefer a softer cereal anyway the thing that really stands out for me is the honey taste even more so than the nut taste it still is a great combination though i think they really hit a home run with this cereal and i will probably buy more this can also be eaten dry as a snack it tastes good on it is own with no milk too i think i may have found a new favorite cereal at calories per serving it fits into my diet as well ,1
i bought some bags of these because i love the david brand dill pickle seeds these do not taste like dill pickle they taste horrible never buy they literally made me vomit in my mouth a little,0
one cat more than two weeks no smell except the very slight pine sawdust smell of the stuff itself better by far than clay based or the wheat based litters the wheat gets nasty smelling after a day ,1
this is another flavor of zevia that i really enjoy i prefer this to their ginger ale this is great straight out of the can or over some natural sugar free vanilla ice cream root beer float ,1
i tried these froose gummy snacks at a gluten free convention and i was immediately hooked i often snack on those welch is fruit snacks that are fairly popular and found within lots of vending machines but these gummies from froose have so much more nutritional value and are made with wholesome organic ingredients the snacks are still very sweet but they have more substance to them and you can taste the fruit juice and the lack of corn syrup my only complaint is that the pouches are small and i am always wanting more but i guess portion control is a good thing give these gummies a shot and you will not be disappointed ,1
from jonny bowden phd c n s agave syrup nectar is basically high fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food sorry do not kill the messenger it is easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation even the word agave has a fine pedigree coming from the greek word for noble the blue agave species considered the best for the making agave nectar flourishes in rich volcanic soil it is also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila and extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti inflammatory and antioxidant properties unfortunately there is zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup agave nectar is an amber colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar the health food crowd loves it because it is gluten free and suitable for vegan diets and most especially because it is low glycemic we will get to that in a moment largely because of its very low glycemic impact agave nectar is marketed as diabetic friendly what is not to like as it turns out quite a lot agave nectar has a low glycemic index for one reason only it is largely made of fructose which although it has a low glycemic index is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener with the exception of pure liquid fructose agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener all sugar from table sugar to hfcs high fructose corn syrup to honey contains some mixture of fructose and glucose table sugar is hfcs is agave nectar is a whopping percent fructose almost but not quite twice as high as hfcs fructose the sugar found naturally in fruit is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples about percent fructose it comes with a host of vitamins antioxidants and fiber but when it is commercially extracted from fruit concentrated and made into a sweetener it exacts a considerable metabolic price research shows that it is the fructose part of sweeteners that is the most dangerous fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides a risk factor for heart disease it also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes heart disease and metabolic syndrome aka pre diabetes and fructose has been linked to non alcoholic fatty liver disease rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides weight gain and extra abdominal fat in the agave plant most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin which actually has some health benefits it is considered a fiber but there is not much inulin left in the actual syrup in the manufacturing process enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar fructose resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is at best percent and much more commonly as high as percent agave syrup is almost all fructose highly processed sugar with great marketing said dr ingrid kohlstadt a fellow of the american college of nutrition and an associate faculty member at johns hopkins school of public health fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when consumed at higher doses she told me many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance they get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood sugar is ok agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science true it has a low glycemic index but so does gasoline that does not mean it is good for you ,0
this is a very light delicious honey i decided to look at amazon after not being able to find any acacia honey on a few trips to whole foods i am glad i did because i found this amazing honey i ordered three but will definitely order more soon the seller honey republic is amazing too ,1

i purchased vitacost extra virgin coconut oil after learning of the health benefits of louric acid abundantly present in the oil being from the commonwealth caribbean i am used to cooking with coconut oil and other uses of the product but i was astonished at the results used after using coconut oil as a skin moisturizer in one week my hands went for ashy to sassy to classy a woman told me i had beautiful hands even more impressive was the improved tone and suppleness of my skin after three weeks a lot of fellas do not realize that as a man you have to keep your dermatological situation moisturized my lady approves saying that my skin was soft and smooth when we met in spain i purchased a vitacost oil and sent it to her in chile i genetically inherited good skin from my family but the oil noticeably improved my skin is smoothness and suppleness my cousin a guy saw me one day and said you look great and refreshed i instantly uttered two words coconut oil i advised him to get it he got his vitacost oil two week later i saw him he said thank you so much for the coconut oil recommendation i used it as a moisturizer and on my hair i love it my girlfriend tells me my skin is smoother she is using it now she had some dry skin issues that have disappeared after using the oil i said i know from now on coconut oil and i are inseparable partners for life with coconut is my oil wife vitacost brand is high quality and low cost just look at the other brands it gets two thumbs up and five stars ,1
sometimes the reduced fat version of a product is not as tasty as the original but that is not the case here these cookies taste every bit as good as the original version that contains more fat this is one of several different kinds of cookies that i eat regularly to satisfy my sweet tooth it has a nice texture a good chocolate taste and is perfect for dipping in milk without falling apart ,1

organic ingredients are only the first positive the intense ginger flavor lingers on my tongue i feel like i can breathe it in that is a real positive for me too many ginger cookies are blah newman is own are superb crunchy and relatively low fat finally someone who understands how much i relish a real hit of ginger i am not sure if i will share them or hide them in the back of my pantry ,1
so i purchased these on a whim they are very quick to prepare under minutes this makes it a perfect quick filling meal these have a good amount of weight to them the noodles are thick and flavorful the sauce is very tasty as well little bit of a tang slightly hot but very flavorful the crushed peanuts included is a nice touch and definitely make it more filling also worth noting is you do not need a microwave to make these it sure does make things easier but you can prepare the noodles with just hot water as well by covering and letting sit for a few overall very satisfied it tasted much better than the minutes of preparation would have me expect i see myself purchasing more of these and trying other annie chun foods i recommend these ,1
i have a cat who takes bp meds and prednisone all i have to do is put the pills in the pocket hole pinch the ends together and she thinks she is getting a treat i have another cat who is not so easily fooled she is on thyroid medication so i put the pill in the pocket pinch it closed mix it with a can of fancy feast gravy lovers and she does not even realize she is getting her medication ,1
i do not generally care too much for the healthy alternatives especially when it comes to coffee however after trying truvia at a hotel i am now hooked i usually get it at the grocery store but it is good to see that it is available on amazon and now that i have prime i might just be getting it online instead this sweetener tastes really good and in addition to coffee i have had it with desserts and it tastes great i think it even tastes better than sugar and definitely tastes better than splenda i cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners but i am sure that there is plenty of information available on the internet related to that as a casual coffee drinker i highly recommend truvia however you may want to try one of the smaller box sizes before purchasing a larger quantity just be sure that you like it ,1
i like the taste of this coffee package plus the convience of using it i would recommend it to anybody who travels a lot and want cream and sugar in their coffee much better than hotel coffee ,1

this is the rice flour for gluten free cooking unlike other rice flours the super fine grind is not gritty so baked goods can have the same smooth finish as those made from wheat flours if tightly wrapped it keeps indefinitely in the freezer so one can afford to buy it in bulk i also highly recommend authentic foods superfine brown rice flour and gluten free flour blend my wheat eating husband says the cinnamon rolls i baked with it are the best he is ever eaten wheat or no wheat gluten or no gluten if you have been disappointed with other brands as we were you really should try this ,1

the cones were perfect size for what we had in mind they were in great condition when received and were received earlier than expected great product ,1
yes it may seem odd but i enjoy eating this stuff myself a couple of times a week a small bowl is very filling and i love the just slightly sweet taste not overpowering and very close to european baby foods for example by brands like alete and milupa try it with hot milk and enjoy ,1
i quit sodas over a year ago due to the unhealthiness of them i do however like bubbly drinks but i do not need the sugar or sodium that is why this product is perfect it is fruit juice carbonated for the bubbliness orange is one of my favorite flavors this drink is the perfect drink i think this product is even better than orange soda orange soda is sticky but this product is not it has the perfect amount of sharpness which i love because it is fruit juice it also has the perfect amount of natural sweetness so this product is all the good things rolled into fruit juiceno added sugarbubblyawesome orange flavorit is so good it is hard to believe you are drinking something healthy ,1
i like this product because it is priced well and does not leave a mess it is also from free range cattle so there is a different aroma to the chew sticks the smell get my dogs excited and it is not obnoxious or overwhelming it is subtle pleasant and fades after a few hours i think it is a wonderful product for pets who get into trouble while you are gone it keeps them occupied and your shoes furniture safe ,1
dear artic zero i was so excited when i saw you at a health market today bought you even though it was pretty expensive i could not wait to try it so then i had it outside of the market and right then i wanted to go back in to return it but i did not want to do something like that so i gave it another try and took another bite hoping that it would change my mind nope i gave it another try hoping that it was something that would grow on me and once again nope after a couple of minutes the side started to melt a bit and i gave that part a try hoping it might taste better well guess i got too hopeful cause it did not so what did it taste like diluted something i could not taste the chocolate nor could i taste the mint at first it tasted like nothing diluted something then after a few bites of it tasted unpleasant i was tempted to just toss it out unsatisfied customer,0
i am not sure why this item has such terrible reviews i love this stuff the texture is very sticky and it can be hard to spread but it tastes great and you can not beat the low fat low cal benefits it tastes more like a roasted peanut spread than the usual peanut butter but it is still completely sweet and yummy it is like a mix between natural peanut butter and the real stuff just as sweet but more peanut y and without the gross oily stuff that is in the top of the jar on natural peanut butter it makes great sauces and is only ww points for tbs,1
product was as stated however some information on using it would have been helpful we use one teaspoon but found out it was way too much then we just did the tip of the spoon and the tea was great ,1
for those of you out there that are stocking up on emergency supplies this is a really good purchase i had purchased these eggs in a smaller bag in the past at my local camping store and when i saw them here i decided to get some for my emergency supply they taste like what you would expect of powdered eggs but for some reason people want the exact taste of freshly cracked eggs which would make about as much sense as expecting powdered milk to taste exactly like fresh dairy milk go figure i have used these eggs in the past to make brownies microwave brownies at that and they came out ok i personally love to make tomato pepper and onion omelets with these eggs but to each their own i would say are these eggs tolerable enough to eat well considering that one morning i made a cheese and tomato omelet for my wife using these same eggs and she barely noticed the difference until i told her afterwards i would say these eggs work out well in a pinch and in an emergency situation these eggs will taste like gourmet food to those who are starving so this product gets an a in my book ,1
i use honey in my tea and i was hoping to reduce the carbs with this it is actually the opposite both honey and agave have the same carbs per tablespoon and i have to use twice as much as this to get the same sweetness ,0
my cat loves fancy feast when he was found he did not even weigh a pound now a year later he is a healthy he is not fat be any means pounds thanks to fancy feast amazon was great on the shippinh time i thought it would take much longer than the days that it did ,1
this thing is great i am running a bluebird into the icicle into logic and the sound i am getting is tremendous there is little to no noise but it boosts the signal plenty i have had no trouble with not having enough gain i have plenty of sound another thing is that i do not think it feels as light and toy like as a lot of people here have stated just treat it with care and do not drop it like any piece of musical equipment fantastic buy for the money recommended ,1
this is the first davidson is tea that i have purchased and i am pretty happy with it my preference in teas are those with stronger flavors the spiced raspberry has a good combination of tea and spices but you definitely will want to be careful with it the tea tastes really good but smell amazing be careful though because steeping the tea too hot and especially too long will result in an very overpowered bitter flavor if this happens turn it into iced tea this will mild it down and tastes delicious i am sure after i get through the entire pound of tea i will be wanting something different but i will likely get another bag one day overall very happy with the tea and i will be trying other davidson is teas ,1
my husband who has traveled to india and experienced chai in that environment loves this tea amongst all the chai that is on the market today this is the one he prefers i think it might be the zing that i attribute to hot pepper that has been added to the tea mix i am not as fussy about my chai as he is but i prefer this tea also try it you will like it ,1
disclaimer was given a bottle of this kenya peach to try for free in exchange for writing a review the taste is nice and peachy not too sweet really yummy but despite the claims on the bottle the ingredient list reads filtered spring water organic evaporated cane juice peach juice concentrate natural flavors citric acid fruite and vegetable juice for color coffee fruit is not listed so i am not sure if this drink actually contains the coffee fruit if it is in there i would expect to see it among the ingredients regardless it is a nice drink for free ,1
i have been eating erewhon crispy brown rice day after day for months without any signs of gluten intolerance and without any slow development of allergies or a reaction the texture is ok but unexciting the taste bland ,1
this cereal tastes very good it has some fiber but not a lot which is good many people do not want high fiber cereal others do not want a low fiber cereal so this one meets both requirements it has just the right amount of fiber only complaint is that part of it is buffed balls so the box does not have the same weight as other boxes of natural cereal otherwise i highly recommend this cereal ,1
you have heard the story about how the baby ruth candy bear was not named for babe ruth but for ruth cleveland daughter of president grover cleveland well sorry to disappoint you but that story is not true the first baby ruth bars were made by the curtiss candy company which was founded in chicago in by otto schnering who used his mother is maiden name since it was much more american sounding and would not cause the problems that a german surname would during world war i the first confection made by curtiss was the kandy kate which featured a pastry center topped with nuts and coated with chocolate then in revised the product so that was now a log shaped bar made of caramel and peanuts covered in chocolate priced at only five cents half the cost of competing candy bars schnering named it the baby ruth bar which soon became one of the hottest selling candies on the market now the explanation that the candy bar was named for baby ruth cleveland the former president is first born daughter has been the official explanation proffered by the curtiss candy company since the is while the babe ruth legend has been the obvious explanation especially since ruth had joine the yankees in and in the year the baby ruth debuted he hit a then record home runs however the idea that the baby ruth bar was named after ruth cleveland is rather morbid given she died of diptheria at the age of in seventeen years before the candy bar was named the more reasonable explanation seems that the curtiss candy company did indeed find a way to link their product to the yankee slugger who was becoming the most famous person in the country ironically curtiss had to fight off a challenge from a competitor who was attempting to market the babe ruth home run bar endorsed by the babe himself the curtiss claim that the bar was named for ruth cleveland was enough to fight off the challenge since the names were too close to one another to allow the new product to be marketed that way the fact that curtiss maintained for years that the baby ruth bar came out before years before babe ruth became famous is enough to pop the balloon since in ruth had broken his single season home run record of by hitting round trippers of course all that matters now is that this is still a classic american candy bar beneath the milk chocolate coating of nestles popular ounce candy bar is a chewy peanut covered center wrapped in a nougat that is really more of a white or blonde fudge in terms of caloric ration the baby ruth is carbs fats and protein the candy bar is low in sodium and very low in cholesterol which is good but high in saturated fat which is supposedly bad where do people think the taste comes from a large portion of the calories come from the sugars which is how nature intended it if you want a candy bar with actual peanuts in it the baby ruth is still a good choice ironically i did find a champion cocker spaniel named baby ruth whelped in who was in all probability actually named for president cleveland is daughter ruth who had been the first child to be born in the white house the previous year she was bred by joseph smith of canada and sold to andrew laidlaw and became the foundation on which mepal built one of the strongest kennels in the united states all three best in show cocker spaniels at the westminster dog show could trace their pedigree back to this particular baby ruth ,1
shipment of pods came with a best before date that was a full months before delivery be aware that amazon lists all grocery items as non returnable ,0
this toy is great fun my dog enjoys playing with it however toys like this are typically used to slow down how fast your dog is eating due to the design of this toy your dog may get frustrated or lose intrest in eating his full meal by playing with the toy because they do have to work very hard to get a treat or be big enough to grab the toy in their mouth and dump the food treats out if your looking for something to slow your dogs eating down then look at other toys like the kong wobbler or the steggin egg you will almost be gaurenteed your dog gets his full meal with those toys ,1

i bought these not for an after workout bar but for a morning lunch bar when i am running low on time these taste great have a true cocoa taste to them why are these not so good after workouts after a hard workout you need some sugar my coach would not let me eat these after a workout unless i drank something with some sugar in it to supplement these after workouts drink chocolate milk why you get tons of protein and some sugar from the chocolate which makes it a great mix it also tastes great compared to actual protein shakes ,1
we have cats who were getting a little chubby on a nice all you can eat mixed variety of dry food i have been reading up on best nutrition for cats which does call for wet food as well i tried numerous canned foods to no avail my dogs were happy about that they get the leftovers finally we found this food and they lick their plate clean each morning first found this in our local health food store and the ingredients seem to be high quality i went on amazon and found it bought a case and continue to be really satisfied with the product ,1

my gf and i eat jalapenos like fricking crazy we put them on everything sometimes we just eat them straight from the jar our grocery store recently stopped carrying this brand and we made the mistake of trying a couple others they all sucked compared to delallo is there is just no comparison will be ordering cases online from now on they store well and i do not anticipate waking up one day and not liking jalapenos anymore delallo is jalapenos are about a on the hotness scale and a perfect on the crispy crunchy scale the other brands we tried were somewhat hotter but mostly mushy and not fun to eat delallo is is a smaller family owned brand located in pa i would much rather support them than some gigantic agribusiness corporation like vlasic which is owned by pinnacle which is in turn owned by the blackstone group i do not know about you but i do not feel great about buying my food from an alternative asset management and financial services company that specializes in private equity real estate and credit and marketable alternative investment strategies ,1
this coconut oil is the best i have tried and i have tried three other brands nutiva organic extra virgin coconut oil tastes and smells like coconut and it makes any food cooked with it taste amazing i use it for frying i add it to my morning oatmeal or amaranth i put it on baked sweet potatoes with a sprinkle of nutmeg and i use it in baking as a substitute for any other oil that the recipe calls for i tried nutiva for the first time over a year ago and bought a small jar the first time just to check it out now i buy a gallon each time i order it sits on my counter next to the stove so it is readily available for any cooking or baking i might do i respect the nutiva company as its mission is to nourish people and planet by using healthy organic ingredients enriching the soil and supporting just and sustainable causes ,1
i love john west products and these are also great although i find these specific herring a little on the sweet side for my liking ,1
honest i am not patrick i am patrick is wife on with the review the yellow is probably the best tasting to me my kids like it too followed by the pink and then the purple varieties each can contains servings the product uses melatonin and valerian as it is relaxation ingredients other ingredients include sugar b vitamins rose hips acai berry and natural flavors i split a can between my kids when we are transitioning from a break schedule back to a school schedule we are all night owls and early mornings can be rough for us so when i need to get them back into a schedule we rely on this stuff within a half hour or so they are in their beds asleep i of course tried it for myself and it really does calm the body down making it easier to fall asleep i highly recommend this product if you can find it i can not say much about the price since it varies from each vendor i find mine locally at the gas station here you may go to their site and see if it has places you can purchase in your town city ,1
i know this is baby food but i do like to know what my baby is eating so i always taste test new baby foods before i feed it to her now there is some baby foods that are higher on the disgusting level of tasteless mush and others that are lower this particular brand is actually quite good the flavors are fresh and fruity and without the taste of anything too artificial though there is still that citric acid tang i find that preservative tang taste to be pronounced in some baby foods i have tried but it is not as bad here particularly in the fruits i do not know why but i appreciate it even if my baby does not seem to notice the pears mangos is by far the tastiest in my adult opinion though my baby seems to enjoy the apple blueberry and apricots they definitely taste lower in sugar than some of the other baby foods we have tried which is awesome too she did not enjoy the winter squash sweet potato or any of the other vegetable meat grain combinations including the banana oatmeal and i have to concur with her opinion i think citric acid was again used as a preservative and it added a rather unpleasant taste into those mixes so i say stars to the fruit combinations pretty easy to get baby to eat them but would not recommend the vegetable meat combinations was actually easier to get baby to eat steamed vegetables ground up in my food processor ,1
this stuff tastes good and is really easy to make i like to drink it warm with some whipped cream but it makes me feel really full and my tummy hurt a little bit and then about minutes after i drink it i always always poop a lot i definitely prefer using natural tea leaves from whole foods and then making my own chai latte and frothing it ,1

this product is wonderful tastes great i make it in a tea pot and pour it on ice and add some kal stevia to sweeten it i read that it is good for all women ailments i am not sure it has done that for me because i started using it in my trimester but i did drink it almost every other day at most and i had an easy labor and i was induced too i read that it helps to tone and strengthen the uterus before during and after pregnancy and i believe it did the job ,1

these oz packages of coffee are normally sold in count boxes they have been repackaged into smaller count bags thereby losing the date by which we know if the coffee is stale the coffee i received was stale and might be characterized as the worse i have ever had folgers should not allow its is coffee to be sold this way ,0
the flavors texture and freshness of this product were wonderful it satisfies the sweet craving and there is no sugar as with most sugar free products you have to be careful to limit the amount you eat as the sugar substitute can cause stomach upset and have a laxative effect this product was simply wonderful for me as i have diabetes and am struggling to find things i can eat without blowing my glucose level ,1
i ordered this one pound bag in hopes i would get a one pound bag of individually wrapped candies as the photo in the description shows the individual candies are usually soft and chewy with a light fine dusting of suger the item i received was a one pound bag of candied ginger crystalized suger coating not the soft chewy spicy candy i expected but crystalized ginger one might find around the holidays i like it too but it is not what i ordered the photo is misleading i instead ordered a ounce box of individually wrapped chews and will use this bag of crystalized ginger for recipes ,0
love love love vanilla flavored coffee and this one does not disappoint starbucks has me and i am loyal through and through the aroma upon opening the bag each morning is such a treat the beans are perfectly ground just the way i like them the flavor is smooth and not over powering with vanilla my household is always pleased in the morning when i have chosen to brew this just add a bit of half half with splenda and i know my day is off to a great start ,1
i love it but at least per cent of the people i have tried it on have looked bewildered when they get their first swallow even those who claim to like hot and spicy foods it sure was nice when i lived near a specialty foods market that sometimes carried it ,1
i love these candies when i eat one there is an explosion of great taste my tastebuds rejoice although the candies are on the small side the flavor pacts a big punch i love the variety of flavors and the fact that they are organic they are truly a must buy ,1
when we adopted our cats several years ago our vet told us it was really important to feed them wholesome food from the beginning they were kittens at the time she recommended wellness brand so we picked up several of the flavors of both wet and dry food for the cats to try both of our cats immediately loved the nuggets in gravy style wet food over the more common pate style and we have not tried a flavor that they will not eat although they do strongly prefer the seafood flavors over chicken or turkey i like the fact that the ingredients are whole foods no fillers or cheap grains although not in this combination they are foods i eat myself salmon cranberries flaxseed zucchini etc i consider this food a win win because the cats love the taste and texture and i love that they are eating whole foods that contribute to their silky shiny coats and general well being ,1
this tea is ground not whole leaf the label on the front of the can states it is leaf tea if you read the label on the back of the can it states that it is rolled to release the flavor i wish they had let my hot water release the flavor instead of leaving it at the roller i will not purchase taylor is of harrogate again false advertising it is not leaf might as well buy bags ,0
i grew up enjoying rice a roni and it is vermicelli rice mix i have never heard of a brown rice vermicelli so when this was offered i jumped at the chance to give it a go i just made a package of it and must say i am very pleased with both the taste and texture very simple to make a nice and healthy meal i tried these plain to get a feel for their taste texture which was pleasantly nutty then i put the pesto sundried tomato sauce with sauteed shrimp i had made for it mixed it together and it turned out to be a stunning tasting and simple meal to pull together i will be adding this to my master grocery list app for sure it is nice to have something different than just rice or pasta for dinner ,1
lets start with my qualifications ha i drink about to cups of black coffee a day and have tried different roasts and beans over the years to nail what i consider the best for me in price and flavor i tried some expensive coffee beans that ended up in an open container in the fridge just to take away the odors instead of throwing it away i tried tarbucks my favorites verona colombian and sumatra and their anniversary blend then here comes coffee beans direct my find for quality price and variety and started telling my people about them i tried coffee bean direct is coffee for about a year now i used to get the six bean espresso blend for a while then i bought four lb bags of different coffee beans to try to find something different for a change or to discover something better for my palate and to use them in my saeco odea automatic espresso machine in lattes and americanos i tried in order of my liking city roast papua new guinea dark sumatra dark brazilian santos and still have a french roast bag that i have not tried yet and i would place the six bean espresso blend between the dark sumatra and the brazilian santos maybe even tied with the sumatra now again this is in regards to the ability to make great americanos and lattes i drink americanos during the week and lattes on weekends like i said i drink my coffee black with no additives and filtered water do not like to spoil the subtle aromas and flavors of course unless is a latte made an americano with the papua new guinea for my girlfriend which also likes good coffee on her way to work and she called me just to ask me what kind of coffee i used because it was excellent i also had noted that it is excellent for my americano but i noticed that i need an extra shot of espresso for my lattes to make the flavor strong enough for me in comparison to the dark sumatra and the six bean blend anyhow i think this is an excellent coffee bean i have not tried it with drip coffee but the espressos are just excellent again for my palate and my girlfriends apparently not too bitter not to acid great aroma which is a big part of the experience it does not cause me heartburn i hope it helps someone to make a decision ,1
i have lived in the states for years and my mom has been faithfully sending me care packages which contained caro kaffee pero among other goodies i happened to see the container in a catalog and immediately went online to search for it and here it is i grew up on this stuff and gave it to my kids disguised as kids coffee my mom said that they used to roast their own during the war because real coffee was scarce anyway it has a mild flavor somewhat like weak coffee the powder form foams up a little especially if the water is too hot the crystals in the dark roast dissolve easier but that is no big deal so i stir a few more times we add sugar and milk as with coffee and enjoy it does not hit a nervous stomach as caffeine would and no it is not a superior coffee if that is what you are looking for because it is not coffee i can not wait to tell my mom that she no longer has to mail it to me enjoy ,1
i sent the bouquet to my sister for the last hollydays she was very happy even they sent me a picture with the very nice flowers they had and i am very happy to send it the price was very accesesible thank you very muchteddy asch,1
okay we try as hard as we can to eat as little sugar and as little white flour as we can but it is hard one still needs sweets and snacks especially with kids these are great whole wheat and sweetened with fruit juice instead of a more refined sugar this may make me a bad mom but on mornings when we are running late and i know we do not have time for a good and normal breakfast i will give the girls one of these with milk they are getting fruit and whole grain so i say they are not for everyone because if you are used to fig newtons you will probably not like these if you are not used to eating products for their whole grain content and lack of refined sugars you probably will not like these i used to love fig newtons but in a effort to be more healthy i gave them up and now only eat these it has been long enough now that we have been eating healthier that i like the taste of these the girls knew no better they had never had a real fig newton so had nothing to compare to and they just eat these up i do not know that we could go through a case of we just buy one package at a time at our local coborn is and we do not go through them that fast as they are a treat not a daily thing or anything so ,1
everyone complaining about the price should really take a walk to a coffee store or caffe coffee has risen in price the past couple years add to that the euro and you will know why these capsules are more money btw currently amazon has a pack of canes for that is free shipping and comes out to which is what the cans costed when they initially rolled out the iperespresso system i have been using the black can for some time now do not even consider buying the red medium roast this dark roast is exactly what espresso should be like dark and bold and delicious the crema produced from this coffee is very very good sugar will sometimes just sit on the top as a proper espresso should my review is for the black top can which is my favorite one i have also tried the red blue and green i have already given my impression on the red it is so so the blue top can is for luongo long shots these are excellent for making an americano use two of these pods plus very hot and you will have an absolutely delicious americano coffee the green top cans are decaf and i am not a big fan of decaf but they are decent i always have a can around for when guests like to have a decaf espresso so each espresso will cost you cents while that is a pretty hefty price you are getting caffe quality espresso which would run you about in any coffee shop it is a lifestyle choice you could always get a stove top macchinetta from bialetti and make espresso that way but you will never ever achieve the quality and crema like these illy capsules produce enjoy your coffee everyone ,1
i was particularly thrilled to be able to order the pennant fruitcake mix a month after the holidays because i was delayed in obtaining another ingredient in my year old unfruitcake recipe i ordered four containers and they could have been packaged better but you know i could not order from the manufacturer and the stores were clear out of it not to mention jacking up the prices so i should not complain now i can make my unfruitcake throughout the year even though the candied fruit and nuts are in it it does not otherwise resemble a fruitcake lol ,1
i have ordered alot of different ones but these are the best yet they are also organic with natural colorings and flavors now you can not beat that the taste is quite true to the flavors which are all great i only purchase the best for our grandchildren and of course us also ,1
wow finally there is an awesome gluten free pasta i am in heaven they are worth every penny i have tried their fettucine penne and spaghetti pasta so far and enjoyed them all i just ordered more from amazon although the other rice and potato pastas out there are tolerable they just do not have the right taste and texture so i had slowly given up on eating pasta now i am in love with pasta again thank you le veneziane ,1
i am a huge pumpkin spice fan and this coffee for the keurig system is fantastic tastes great love it if you like pumpkin spice coffee you will not be disappointed ,1
my two sons and i are on a strict gluten free diet since being diagnosed with celiac disease a couple of years ago i have tried many different bread mixes but this is everybody is favorite after having perfected the recipe a bit i use the gluten free cycle on my breadman pro machine total time hour minutes originally the main problem with the bread was that it would rise to the top of the machine but after removing it from the pan it would partially collapse towards the sides ending up with an hour glass shape after trying several remedies i discovered that the best way to prevent this partial collapse from happening was to wait for the end of the gluten free cycle and then bake the bread on the bake cycle for an additional to minutes once you do this you can remove the bread and it maintains its shape and is fluffy and delicious a few other suggestions that i would make use coconut milk so delicious coconut milk beverage instead of water or milk use olive oil instead of regular oil use three eggs instead of one egg and egg whites then add an extra tablespoon of olive oil for extra fluffinessif you follow these steps you will have fluffy moist delicious bread baked to perfection enjoy ,1
great food for the master is best friend it is all natural and my dog love is it before we tried these she had trouble keeping other dog food digested and she would leave accidents on the floor now she is trouble free and gets the vitamins and required nourishment she needs ,1
i had these when i live in australia for years they taste so delicious i brought some in australia at the wholesaler for a pack i ended up with a whole suit case which is packets within a week my family and i consumed the whole suitcase these are the best cookies u can also find tim tams at asian stores ,1
note the back of the package gives you options as to what you can add to the mix there is a cake like optin fudgy non oil etc i used the fudgy recipe and it was fabulous they had a wonderful flavor i got them on a whim suspecting one of my children may have a problem with gluten even if he tests ok i will buy these again i actually prefer in some ways to the duncan hines brand i normally use my son has eaten them up we do not notice any aftertaste which has been mentioned in other reviews maybe they used a different recipe than fudgy i actually did notice the chocolate had a very rich taste like they used a high quality coco powder ,1
i really enjoy eating the sugar laden graham crackers but i prefer these natural honey oat grahams now these are satisfying with the oats and the honey adds a slight touch of sweetness i use these to hold me over until lunch time but they are a great snack for any time one pack contains a fair amount of graham crackers and at this price i think its a great value for six boxes of these delicious grahams i will never go back to unhealthy standard graham crackers these oat grahams revived my love for grahams ,1
i like earl grey tea and prefer it to any other tea earl grey from stash is great product anda box of is a good dial highly recommend ,1
last of the mistake of ordering pack of snacks i never tasted prolly just dry edamame is not for me esp after jaw surgery this is still a bit too hard for me to eat at this point so maybe is just hard for me to review this with it being a very hard crunch that i should still avoid but it is not really something i would be craving if i am in snack mood it did not make sense to bother with this as i love the japanese style cooked edamame and this is no subsitute for that then they are soft and so much easier to eat and you sprinkle some salt on them and hmmmm so i suggest stay with the cooked ones as i think jaw surgery or not these beans just taste way better that way yeah is more work u just need time boil them yes once you do that tho it is a snack you could then salt and take with or prolly keep in fridge a few days ,0
these pretzels are much less sweet than funky chunky is caramel pretzels they are supposed to have lots of peanut butter flavor but it is mighty scarce in the cannisters i received light on the chopped peanuts too for chocolate covered pretzels they taste good and were fresh and crispy but if you had your taste buds set on peanut butter you will be disappointed update i e mailed funky chunky about these pretzels and promptly same day got a call from them they sent out replacement cannisters arrived via ups in days i must have gotten a bad batch the first time cause these are just great plenty of caramel peanut butter and chopped peanuts very enjoyable product and funky chunky is certainly responsive to their customers comments ,1
my wife orders these for the kiddos when they are on sale and it is a good deal as you may know these little cans hold that disgustingly awesome ravioli i usually take these on backpacking trips since they are pretty good easy to eat and awesome for out of the can and into the man as i always say ,1
this dark brazilian coffee is the best coffee bean direct whole bean is the best of their coffees so for i have tried three other of their whole bean cofees and this is the most richest smoothest and flavorable i love my coffee ray ,1
panda licorice is very unique and has an herbal taste to it i bought the original flavor the flavor lasts long after you have swallowed a piece which is a huge plus i also love that it is healthy and all natural great alternative to ordinary candy ,1
this is awesome coffee first one my husband and i both agree on we started with one small box from the grocery store and now buy in bulk from amazon,1
well anything with jalapeno and i am sure to love it sorry not the case here right out of the bottle it has an almost sour taste to it picture old mayo mixed with fake smoke with a dash of some kind of spice that does not even resemble jalapeno i put it on some chips and almost gagged i put it on some salad but the other dressing thankfully drowned it out not recommended yuck ,0
we have a groundhog living under our garage we poured a whole canister down his hole and he still sits in there looking at us as if to say what was that supposed to do do not waste your money if you have real critters i e anything bigger than a squirrel ,0
i bought two kinds of davidson is bulk teas darjeeling and gunpowder green and i was very disappointed in the quality they both make kind of a murky harsh tea the darjeeling is very light in color and has an aftertaste more like pekoe the gunpowder green is weak and flat i certainly would not recommend them ,0
this is the only chew toy that consistently holds my dogs attention and it is good for their gums and teeth i stock up on them every year ,1
we did not eat these right away but kept them a month or two until our current supply of almonds was gone we eat a lot so we buy them in bulk we opened two packets of these both were inedibly rancid it was past the day return deadline so we threw them all away i believe that a vacuum packed product like this sold in bulk should remain edible for many months ,0
i normally drink a lot of tea and coffee but find it difficult to spend the money on tea for the keurig because tea bags are a much better price per cup and i was skeptical about how flavorful a k cup tea would be that being said i have been pleasantly surprised about the flavor of this tea and would purchase it again i typically make the tea in a oz tervis tumbler using the largest cup setting this ends up being the perfect combination once the ice is added to the cup if you like lemon flavored tea you will probably enjoy this tea however if you do not like the flavor of lemon i would look into purchasing a different flavor of tea the flavor is a typical black tea that has a pretty strong lemon flavor that can be a bit strong as you get to the bottom of the glass you can actually smell the lemon scent when you take a drink also if you do end up purchasing this tea and find that it is not strong enough as prepared with ice make the tea without ice and leave in the fridge overnight ,1
like i said good to the last drop and just bold eoungh to shake out the cobwebs in the am and now they say a couple of cups are good for the heart sortda like dark beer anyway it was another excellent amazon transaction ,1
these chips look very much like a dorito but they pop or snap more when chewing i think these are the best of the flavors maybe too spicy for some but i like that they have some kick if you like a little spice these are great if you have a weak stomach you may need to try the milder seasalt version enjoy i know i will buy these again j b ,1
i am very selective about what type of shampoo that i use because many do not agree with my hair and scalp if i use the wrong shampoo it will make my scalp itchy and will cause flakes a lot of the time shampoo will make my hair feel very oily as well i typically use an anti dandruff shampoo about half of the time and then a regular shampoo the other half i have been using pantene anti dandruff shampoo recently and it has been my recent favorite however i think that i like this shampoo slightly better it has a nice scent and lathers very well it is also a thinner consistency than most shampoo there are two things about this shampoo that make it really good first of all it has twice the pyrithione zinc as many anti dandruff shampoos which makes it very effective it also moisturizes my hair very well and leaves it very soft and manageable ,1
i have a jrt who is very picky about treats he loves these i like that there is no corn syrup here as in many soft treats the best thing about these is they are soft enough to mold around his pills and he just gulps them down ,1
i love nuts so i thought i would try these just horrible tasting i could not tell if they were old or just over roasted so much for trying to save a penny i will never order these again i ordered from city nuts and candy in hollywood florida and they are the best so that is were i will continue to order from i would rather pay alittle more to get quality that get a bad product and have to spend more money to ship the item back ,0
the product is probably fine but i failed to note that it was decaf i got excited about the price and flavor my wife is favorite and failed to notice the decaf unfortunately i am now stuck with several unopened boxes i can not return due to the return policy that would not exist if i just paid regular price in a store no problem with the coffee my wife loves the regular just be careful as you can not correct for quick reads ,1
i ordered this for the time the first and second time i liked it and the time was disgusting i can taste the tin can and the pulp tasted old i never leave feedback but this was so gross ,0

i saw amazon was selling this but seeing as a lot of people were receiving bad shipments i decided to find it in my local grocery store first before going with amazon it is good i am used to eating drinking from the thai coconuts which are sweeter than this but i like these brazil ones too i happened to buy a bunch on sale at the store and was worried they might be rancid but they were not i am taking this on my road trip to help with the heat although i am sure i will find some coconuts where i am going ,1
i tried this tea for the first time today i enjoyed it i can not really say it tasted like eggnog because to me it did not but it still had a nice seasonal taste to it i would buy it again ,1
i have not purchased miso from eden yet but eden makes high quality products and i have never been disappointed this is just to clear up the comment made about this making a flavorless miso soup because i believe it is user error and not this product that was the culprit if you want miso soup like you get in the restaurants you have to make your own dashi a japanese soup broth then you use this dashi as the base of your miso soup instead of water and you will get a very flavorful soup making dashi is easy all you have to do is bring kombu dried kelp and bonito flakes to a boil simmer lightly then strain the flakes and kombu from the resulting broth use this broth in place of water for your soup by following directions on the package and you will be good to go ,1
i went to the local asian market and got ripped off for a poor quality product i found this on amazon and for a much better price i got a high quality real japanese product japanese soy sauce has more soy than wheat the opposite is true for american produced sauces it is savory with a soft finish perfect for all my rice needs highly reccomend this product ,1

i love this coffee sure there are better brands but they cost an arm and a leg and i just think this was a great deal the delivery was very fast and of course the price was right very happy with my purchase ,1
i received what i had hoped for the packaging was pleasing and the price was right i also liked the variety of teas that were sent ,1
alfredo sauce is mostly cheese and cream based anyway so the zero carb selling point while true does not justify the high price tag in my opinion most any alfredo sauce should be low carb in the first place the reason why most are not is because the thickness in alfredo sauce comes from flour or wheat flour to give it that heartiness we are used to this product does not contain flour so it is a lot thinner than traditional alfredo sauce would otherwise be and is pretty much cream cheese and a bunch of spices the funny part is that alfredo sauce is typically used with pasta which is chock full of carbs so you are really not going to gain any low carb points by using a sauce that has grams on a bowl of pasta that has grams in terms of taste this product like many other diet products tastes off you would probably be able to tell it was trying to mimic alfredo sauce but you would know something was not quite right about it it is not a bad taste but like other reviewers have said it is kind of a strong tangy and in many ways synthetic taste it is not great bottom line and walden farms makes some other really good products so personally i would skip this one that being said it is truly a dieters product with zero carb calories fat etc so with that in mind it is not a bad product when you consider it does not contain all the stuff that usually makes food taste good ,0

lundberg sets the bar when it comes to rice cakes this is truly the perfect staple and when you need something healthy while traveling rice cakes are the ideal solution i have even been known to carry them in my purse into a restaurant so i have an option to the potato or rice that the chef smothers in butter or some other sauce full of fat lightness in the belly that shows up on the bathroom scale ,1
i am a bit of a coffee snob and grind my own beans each day i like a smooth full flavored coffee and the fresher the better i was hoping this would be a nice chg of pace especially over the holiday season i brewed up a pot after our thanksgiving dinner the ranges of opinion were who likes lots of sugar and cream thougth it was who likes it bare bones called it bitter with an odd after varied from people who used a little cream and minimal sugar the people that gave it the best rating were the ones that doctored up the brew with a lot of sugar and heavy like me who just uses a splash of cream felt it was way too bitter and not smooth at all in fact it had a rather harsh taste sorry this will not be one of the flavors we will be using in the future though i do like a number the gevalia blends this is not one of them,0
we really enjoy this coffee we recommend to store it in an airtight container after opening to maintain it is full flavor we enjoy it as an evening coffee ,1
i have tried almost every flavor of celestial is holiday teas and all have been amazing this one has a warm cookie flavor with stronger notes leading to the lemony side i was expecting it to be more of a strong cookie spice type flavor but on first impression it reminded me of those lolipops that have the loop instead of the straight stick maybe the green one lol i found that this one is best if you steep it a little longer than the recommended minutes it can be a faint light taste at first but does get that warmer feeling if steeped a bit longer overall it is a great flavor and tastes great with and without milk i often force my friends to try all my new teas and everyone seemed to enjoy this one with no complaints if you are looking for more of a spice warm cookie type flavor of tea i would highly recommend celestial is gingerbread spice ,1
i received a sample to try of this k cup for my brewer i tried it and i really enjoyed the flavor it produced i will definitely be buying this again as the taste was great ,1
adorable little bottles that look great next to a plate of waffles or pancakes when company or my parents are over having to refrigerate jam jelly once its opened makes it a pain and can be messy i love that the price per once is great and these individual jars can be opened and used and not take up space in my fridge my kids love them and we have a handful in our emergency kit along with peanut butter good stuff ,1
friends who feed their year old primarily with this product introduced us to baby gourmet organic we gave it a try and young and old like it my year old as well as my year old said they like it you can definitely taste the pears and broccoli apparently you can microwave this puree yet it is possible it may lose some of its potency even if you get this product for free like i did you will likely end up buying it afterwards i do not have any complaints to the product i wish the packages would be larger but then again they are supposed to be for babies not hungry adults ,1
we have been gf for months now and tried many different mixes some even more expensive and not loved anything like we love the mixes from the cravings place my daughter is friends even eat these ,1
i recently visited canada where tim horton is is huge and i can see why their brewed coffee is just great it is bold and has a distinct rich flavor i was thrilled to find that i could purchase this from the us and at such a great price and the coffee tastes just as good as i remember not sure how many others do this but i recently started brewing iced coffee which is done by brewing regular coffee at double strength so it does not get too watered down when poured over ice for that purpose i find that i still prefer coffee beans i buy from a certain other popular american chain ca not put my finger on it but i feel like the flavor of tim horton is was meant to be appreciated as hot coffee ,1
this product is just great i now keep a bottle beside the stove and use it all the time i love to roast veggies and have been using this to coat them before i put them in the oven such a great flavor ,1
i ordered this back in feb and it was bucks which was up from the previous time i ordered it i think i am priced out this is way to expensive tastes great but price is prohibitive give it one star for that ,0
i used to buy a much more expensive vanilla bean sold here on amazon feel free to search for my username and see how much i used to over spend i decided to try this option because i would not be in a bind if they were of poor quality or i did not like them ordered them up and they arrived in a few days the smell was wonderful and i am quite pleased with the quality i will definitely purchase again ,1

these are far and away my cats favorite treats i do not get it supposedly it is freeze dried chicken and nothing more explain to me then why do my cats prefer to eat these rather than a can of wet cat food made up of pretty much just shredded chicken these things smell pretty good if you like the smell of chicken that is but that look about as fun to eat as cardboard i do not get it do not bother with any of the other flavors besides the chicken my cats think the shrimp and the liver pieces are toys to bat around until they end up under the refrigerator but they go absolutely bonkers for the chicken oh and buy a bigger size if you can ounces goes pretty fast ,1
this is a nice bold smokey coffee that does not have a bitter finish i enjoy this all day long and provide it to my customers ,1
for all the hype that pitbulls get you would think they could eat license plates dead trees and babies and not flinch the fact is that the dogs are not nearly as tough as the media would mislead you to believe and the reality is most have extremely sensitive stomachs i know what you are thinking awwweee poor pit bulls and that is my sentiment too especially when you live on the floor and need to go up and down and up and down the elevator when they get the runs not fun these treats are perfect for training dogs for small doges for big dogs and for dogs who have sensitive stomachs like pit bulls ,1
it does not work out for me everyone is different only durham is royal jelly works out good for me that i ordered it thru amazon com i use it for more eggs for my ovaries for months it is great for pregnancy ,0
dry and mealy the chunks of chocolate are pretty small many locally available cookies of this type would be a far better choice the last box actually tasted rancid and very unappetizing well before the expiry date sorry but if this is healthy eating be my guest but count me out ,0
i was pointed to this stuff by a friend that told me it was hot and i would like it let me tell you now your out of your mind if you think your going to use this to spice up some normal food only use this extremely sparingly in chili or to make hot wing sauce two penny sized drops in your chili will make it the hottest thing you have ever ate in your life think of eating a habanero pepper that is down right hot this stuff makes a habanero pepper seem like a pickle for a good joke drop a dab of this in your buddy is chew and watch him come unglued ,1
peanut allergy in my home we have been eating this for the last years we like the crunchy best it works great in place of peanut butter when making cookies my husband eats it plain on sandwiches with no compliant kids eat it off the spoon or out of the jar my only with is that they processed in a facility without soy that would help make it perfect good deal here too i only wish it was avilable as a subscribe option ,1
i have eaten many pounds of these peas and they are the best i have also tried several other brands they can not compete with the genuine kasugai brand target is are horrid burnt until browish wasabi falls off and lousy flavor taste burnt and wasabi tastes like american horseradish it probably is sun luck is have a strong nutra sweet flavor ewww kusugai have a nice roasted pea flavor and a real nice wasabi bang that quickly fades leaving you none the worst for wear and wanting more honestly i have tried about different brands and none of them can compete grab a bag and get hooked ,1
because of the shape of this pasta when it cooks it has a much better texture than the other varieties of tinkyada pasta do i would say that it is the closest you can get to regular durum semonila pasta this is my all time favorite rice pasta hands down ,1
we did not know that this item came with cream already in it my husband likes it better without the cream other than that it is good ,1
i love these the only thing is they leave your hands greasy i wonder just how healthy these things are ,1

black tiger is my favorite coffee pod first it is delicious coffee second coffee people pods are the only pods i have seen where you get some crema or the creamy looking froth that high pressure brewing can get this is the sign of a well brewed cup and something that drip cannot duplicate i used to mix up my pods but after trying the black tiger i have boxes and unused pods that will never be used the other coffee people pods also get some crema ,1
this is the best product for peppermint bark i used to crush candy canes when i could not find this product locally then i realized that amazon might have it and joila it produces a much prettier white chocolate peppermint bark than crushed candy canes the price is good and the shipping was super fast i do not know why the vendor offered it as free shipping at this price but i appreciated it i ordered it twice this christmas a total of bags and used them all one bag of peppermint crunch is stirred into two pounds of white chocolate spread on parchment paper and in minutes you have a delectable christmas treat really easy for the kids to help make ,1
excellent coffee perfect cup everytime if you enjoy a good full flavored cup of coffee this is at the top of the list no bitterness coffee is delivered monthly though amazon and always on time customer service has always been excellent to say the least this product and process of delivery deserve a lot of praise ,1
i decided to give the san francisco bay rainforest blend organic arabica onecup a try this morning when i open the box i notice a similar smell as the fog chaser blend but not nearly as strong oddly i find the description on the box exactly the same as that of fog chaser their website shows this as reguler full city roast and describes it as follows our certified organic rainforest blend is an artful mix of coffees from colombia mexico guatemala and indonesia that produces a smooth yet full bodied taste with lively acidic notes the onecup brews perfectly in my and like it smelled befor brewing produced a more delicate cup than the fog chaser but still very flavorful when brewed maybe this is the same blend of coffee beans only roasted alittle lighter the wife and i tend to favor the dark roast extra bold kcups and on occasion medium roasts as well this rainforest blend is alittle light for me but it is really flavorful and wins me over all the same so far i am really liking these offerings from rogers family company and would purchase them again if the price remains competitive to kcups i was originally concerned by the fact they are not individually sealed for freshness the wife and i normally drink cups a day so we can polish off a box of in three days once opened so the coffee does not lose much freshness the downside is we need to drink only these for three days in a row instead of mixing it up depending on how we feel each day as we currently do with kcups if we want to keep them as fresh as possible ,1
i used to be able to buy this in my local supermarket and in bj is wholesale club i preferred bj is because they sold in in a larger size however about a year ago they discontinued it so it was back to hunting supermarket shelves i do not understand why a product this popular is so hard to get thank goodness for amazon i just wish they would carry it in the larger size ,1
i would have expected more from cytomax i was looking for a drink i could use while running and this failed horribly even though this drink is meant to be taken during a workout there is no way you can take it running it foams up to the point where you can not drink it do not waste your money stick to water and gel packs ,0

what a disaster took this seller four days just to start the shipping process it will take another three days to arrive for a total of a week what is this the is and ordering something from the sears catalog beware and stay away proflowers stinks if you do not have the capability and technology for quick shipment especially around a flower holiday like mothers day then do not even try to enter into this business segment i will never buy from proflowers again not very professional time to change your company name ,0
i originally bought this after my toddler had tried some squeeze pack apple sauce and enjoyed the novelty of it she likes applesauce anyway but i thought i might be able to get her to eat some veggies if i could find them in a squeeze pouch too this fruit and veggie mix is perfect she gets some green veggies but it really does taste just like pears i have tried several flavors and this is her favorite by far my baby is starting solids now and she likes this one too ,1

yeah i have to agree i do not know where these one stars are coming from all i have to say about blue sky is best soda eva i mean u get the nice cola flavor but it takes better natural its really good i now hate coke maybe ordering it from a ware house is not best if sodas are left sitting for a lonnng time they do go flat even unopened if you can find it at a local health food store or some where if you go to penn state sisu at west has it its delicious ,1

love these ginger candies i just can not get enough of them not all ginger candy is the same ting ting jehe is the best in my opinion ,1
if the price is too good to believe well it is not these shitake are superior to supermarket brands at about half the price which includes shipping cap sizes are in the to range and are very uniform in shape trust me a pound of dried mushrooms is a lot and at this price you can use them in just about anything hint save the soaking water filter thru a paper towel or coffee filter in a strainer and use like wine stock or water in soups braises or reduction sautes great flavor and can be substituted for porcini or cepes when you do not want to break the bank though they are really best suited to asian dishes the reason they are so much cheaper is that they are cultivated where porcini ceps are gathered in the wild kind of like the difference between wild salmon and farm be advised that this product may or may not be the same as i purchased at the time of my review the vendor is entirely different and i have no confidence the product is from the same source or is in any way similar other than by weight i also question amazon is policy of using my review to promote a different vendor and likely different sourced product from that which i shared my experience with after i posted the above revision amazon added back in the original vendor which i had experience with i do not know if this was coincidental or a result of my additional comment but to ensure this does not become a continual issue let me state that my purchase was made from jr mushrooms specialties and that i stand by the review of the product they provided any other vendor is likely to source this product differently and therefore my review should only be considered when purchasing from jr ,1
great product used the tea for a mother daughter holiday tea and it was a hit would order this tea again,1
my dogs love these cheese treats and will do absolutely anything to earn one the treats are small and stay soft and they must taste great they actually smell pretty good cheesy the treats do not leave crumbs behind i have toy breed dogs and these treats are just the right size and a perfect reward for good behavior ,1
the sparkling ice line up are all extremely addicting this one included i love that they are all flavorful calorie free and carb free gluten free caffeine free and carbonated i used to have periodic cravings for one of my husband is cokes and always hated myself for giving in i always thought it was the sugar i was craving until i tried these a year ago and realized that it is actually the carbonation i would crave these are a guilt free way of feeding those cravings the only thing i would note is that it is sweetened with splenda splenda does not bother me at all but my husband can instantly tell the difference and ends up with a stomach ache any time he consumes it so unfortunately these can not help me to get him off his soda kick so if you are also sensitive to splenda this is not the product for you the kiwi strawberry flavor is not one of my absolute favorites that goes to but it is delicious all the same it is probably the sweetest out of all the flavors though so when i have a bunch of flavors to choose from i do not reach for it as often ,1
i adore white chocolate i admit the price of milka is abit high well alot high but if you do not pig out onany candy all the time the price is worth it problem iswhen you finish one bar next day you want another one and forget eating half a bar and putting away the otherhalf for any length of time you can always find it ,1

we are so pleased to be able to buy xylitol made from birch trees right here in the u s and not from corn in china the price is slightly more but well worth the peace of mind knowing that it is a quality product if in doubt visit emerald forest website ,1
do not buy it is half of the price at nespresso com and the delivery is pretty fast you need to join their club at no cost but it is worth it moreover you can make your own mixing of flavors ,0
it took about ten seconds to realize that this product tastes great to my dogs we have a lab and a pug and both of them attacked their bowls like i would given them steak i am sure they were not happy when i went back to boring hill is the following day but this is not a product i would recommend for keeping any dog healthy the reason i have only given this product four stars is that many of the ingredients are not something i want my dogs eating regularly they do not have many problems with soy but i know a lot of other dogs do they and i do have problems with the heavy use of corn the always worrisome chicken by product and artificial colors that last one seems like an obvious admission from the makers of this product that they are really targeting dog owners more than they are dogs my lab certainly was not awestruck by the various colors on the package my feeling is that this is a nice treat or occasional meal topper for my dogs but it will not be something i purchase for daily consumption both dogs certainly love the taste and i commend chef michael for that but for long term health i would recommend other options ,1
i will first start by saying i am not a fan of starbucks everytime i had coffee there it tasted old and much much too strong and it is ridiculously overpriced i drink my coffee with cream only no sugar or other flavorings when i was offered the opportunity to review pikes place for buzzagent i thought it would be a good idea since i do love coffee and i have never tried starbucks coffee brewed at home i am glad i did pikes place is a nice smooth blend with a great taste very good for any time of day it is just coffee no crazy flavorings and has a slight nutty taste i did receive this as a product test but i will most definitely purchase it as it is quite delicious ,1
the missing star originally two is because this product is melted into a gummi splat there are no gummi bear formations another minus it is hard to open packets and we have to use scissors and then the treat is melted into corners so our scissors get dirty sticky however my colleagues loved them they looked for melting patterns and talk about looking for packs with more red or green melted with green etc so they get a star back ,1
i found this little tasty treat at wild by nature store recently and it is for all chocolate lovers you will not be disappointed i can not wait to try the other kopali products ,1
just like they have always been these pop tarts do not even try to mask themselves as healthy on the basis of a fruit filling as a tasty snack or breakfast treat it is a winner but be prepared there is a lot of them in one box ,1
it was a mistake to buy this product i forgot how truly awful trident gum is i bought a box of trident a box of wrigley is and a box of orbit all at the same time so i could really try them all out the worst was trident each piece of this gum is tougher harder to chew and lasts a fraction of the time the other two gums last after a short time the trident gum starts to make the inside of your mouth feel like it is being burned it is intolerable it has to be spit out whereas the orbit and wrigley is keep their flavor for much longer do not burn the inside of your mouth and are soft to chew i would not purchase trident gum again any flavor ,0
my wife is dairy and gluten intollerant this product allows us to have recipes calling for soy sauce without causing her problems ,1

i bought these back in and i still have a package left in year these will last you a while i do not drink tea everyday though each bag can be re used a few times times each depending on the size of your cup i usualy make tea from a cast iron tea pot but sometimes i am in a rush this tea is excelent tasting oishi desu for baged tea your tea will not be a green as the photo but it will be like a yellow green if your in the market for bagged green tea you my friend just found the right page ,1
without a doubt the most amazing and pure product we have ever tried my wife a medical dietary professional has done the research and believes this oil is the healthiest money can buy my concerns are more taste based and was shocked by how natural and great tasting this brand of olive oil is the seller shipped immediately and the packaging technique kept cold shows how truly special this product is a must for any kitchen or health conscious person ,1
i was hooked on this company is tea twenty years ago on a semester abroad in york england good strong lovely colored rich tasting incomparable brew i am an unashamed tea snob if you like it weak go find something else ,1
my two little yorkies are finicky pups they will eat something when it is new but a week later turn their noses up at it it is been a month now and they are still eating it when i first opened the package they did not exactly jump for joy in fact they backed away from it i held one of the pieces out to them and they seemed very disinterested i was thinking for a minute there they were not going to eat it at all and this is a very big bag of dog food for two little dogs however when i put it in their dish they started eating right away because the pieces are rather large for small dogs they can only eat one piece at a time the food seems to be a bit chewy so it takes a while to eat one piece there is no real oder that i can smell but because it does not smell like pupa roni they are not fighting over it ,1
oh man this stuff is so gross i made it for dinner tonight as a part of my continuing effort to find the perfect chili this one lands dead last on my list i followed the instructions to the letter it had the nastiest flavor or lack thereof my husband actually spit it back out we ended up dumping it and eating out ick do not buy this gag o ,0
these are absolutely terrible i bought them b c they were the only whole grain tortillas that i could find at the time they have awful texture and they absolutely do not taste like a tortilla should to top it off they are not vegetarian or kosher or halal as far as i know why would you put gelatin in a tortilla ridiculous ,0
if you like popcorn chocolate and caramel you are gonna like this stuff a lot and if you like those little pre measured packages with calories or calories or in this case calories you will really like it each calorie package has oz of popcorn with caramel and chocolate drizzled on it and it is not the kind of drizzling where you taste a whole lot of popcorn and very little chocolate or caramel there is a nice balance and you can really taste it the little bags are just the right size to tuck in your purse or briefcase for a quick mid morning or mid afternoon pick me up snack when you are on the go they would also fit well in lunch boxes backpacks or tote bags yum ,1
i have a week old goldendoodle who is fiesty and playful we have several interactive toys and this is one of boomer is favorite we use it all the time but lately my husband who takes care of him in the early morning has been away so i have been on duty after his a m potty i fill it up with his kibble and put him back in his crate and it keeps him busy for a while and then he falls back to sleep it is worth it is weight in gold for us the bottom unscrews so you can put the treats in from there and the ventilation holes allows for the dogs to get a good whiff of the treats it is more challenging than the amaze a ball and keeps our puppy busy ,1
my cat did not like waste of money for me and ya was surprised to see it was just horse bedding pellets ,0
i love the maxwell house international coffees especially the toasted hazelnut it is a smooth creamy tastingcoffee i keep several different flavors in my cupboard at all times,1
i recently purchased this on a gold box deal i was waiting for there to be an incentive before i took the plunge but now that i have these delicious products i realize it is not worth waiting for a deal to pop up as soon as i run out of my bacon salt i am buying more all the bacon salt varieties included in this set have their own subtle variations in flavor my favorite being jalapeno and without having a least favorite they all have a little bite to them that i attribute to black pepper but are not really spicy i am not really sure if they truly taste like bacon i have heard that the bacon flavor needs fat present to manifest itself i do know however that it is so good ill just sprinkle some on my palm and lick it off gross maybe but i bet you would lick my palm too pi have never been a huge fan of either mayo or miracle whip but after trying the baconnaise i think my hierarchy is baconnaise mayonnaise miracle whip i can only imagine making some delicious baconized fry sauce typically mayo and ketchup mixed together try it and be blown away its almost a religion down here if you have been waiting to buy this stuff but have not quite been convinced just take my word for it and buy if you do not like it just send it my way that probably will not happen though unfortunately for me ,1
i was very impressed how fresh the curry smelt and tasted you could definately taste the spice and it is almost as fresh as if i made it myself took less than minutes from start to finish to cook such a time saver when i need to get good dinner on the table i love this prepared mixture as it does not contain any of these crazy preservatives just pure and simple although my chicken mixture did not have the orange glow like the picture on the box more like the picture for the lamb currry it was plenty spicy not too hot but it did have the kick no more frozen curry any more yeah ,1
i am addicted to this candy will try not to order another batch for awhile this is my candy to eat on the ride home from work in traffic to keep me calm ,1
i am sorry but i just have to be honest this chocolate has no flavor of bat in any way shape or form i did a review of the chocolate from the same company with the chimpanzee on the label and noted no flavor of chimp in it i was forced to give it a one star review but did try to be fair and say the chocolate itself if it was sold as just chocolate was fine now they continue this trend of such false labelling and have no bat flavor in this chocolate what gives yes as chocolate it is fine much like the so called chimpanzee flavored bar i tried earlier this year so consider this a four or five star review if the lack of bat flavor does not bother you but does not a chocolate bar with let is say raspberries on the label contain a raspberry extract jelly or something else with raspberry flavor why would not one with a bat on the label contain no bat flavor i may try the other chocolates by this company i am curious to see if the one with the panther on the label does taste at least like some sort of cat if not an actual panther but i am disappointed yet again by this company if you are going to claim to flavor your chocolate to taste like animals include the animal flavor ,0
this box arrived in the same condition as i would expect if buying this from a grocery store be aware that the size of these is kind of small this could be a good thing if you just want to add a small treat to a pack lunch or as a standalone snack for small children an adult could easily eat two of these without too much guilt i would buy this again because the price is not too bad and the count box lasts for a good amount of time ,1
when i received my shipment one bag was completely crushed surprising since all of the bags were surrounded by packing bubbles i contacted the company regarding a return and it took two emails before i received an email back that promised i was receiving a replacement shipment in business days along with a return label that was on november it is now november i emailed them one more time last week asking where my replacement order was and have not heard back from them i will not be buying from them again ,0
these canned pears taste great not much more i can say about them other reviews say it all will be buying more ,1
these are delicious and arrived from lindt packed in a thick styrofoam packing box to guard against melting the price is comparable to grocery store prices ,1
possibly the smoothest full flavored coffee i have ever tasted it has a wonderful mouth filling quality with not even a hint of harshness it is not a weak or wimpy coffee it is rich and very flavorful i just love this coffee in my thermos too because it is just wonderful black and holds well ,1
the product was cloudy and pale not dark and clear like true sorghum syrup the taste and mouthfeel was more reminiscent of gum acacia or gelatin i was very dissapointed and discarded the material as unappetizing at best i found another supplier who is a member of the sorghum syrup producers association and displays their logo ,0
great company gum came packaged well really soft gum product lasted a long time will order from them again,1
i know the new version is supposed to be better for me but it is not anything for me or the company is profits if i will not buy it as i will not eat it i actually threw out the box with unused product in it ,0
this review is for the cinnaman mento is i love them thats all the candy i eat but these were hard instead of chewy like they are supposed to be other than that the taste was delicious,1
we have a very small pounds poodle that is a power chewer she loves this chew and can spend hours simply chewing on it it is very durable and lasts a long time ,1
if you are looking at this bulk item chances are you already know you like the cereal so i will skip trying to explain what it tastes like and tell you about what you will get and how you will get it the package you get is a pretty big amazon box with another cardboard box inside it that inner box is manufacturer packaging shipping material which holds the bags of cereal you can open that box as normal by cutting the packing tape or the box has perforations so grocery stores the obvious intended recipients can rip off the side top of the box making what the box calls a presentation display i guess because the bags lacking their own boxes might not stand on end by themselves so you get the package nature is path sends to grocery health food stores and i guess that is the way amazon does it with most of their grocery stuff this was my first amazon grocery order the flakes did not seem to be damaged from their trip the flakes on this product are pretty hard and small anyway which i am sure helps looking at the six bags of cereal i cut the packing tape instead of doing the display rip out you kind of wonder to yourself and say that does not look like x amount of dollars worth of cereal but cereal boxes are packaged so inefficiently that part of it is an optical illusion i was able to fill up my refillable cereal container and still have maybe of the bag left one of these bags is a little more than two of the box versions will probably close and maybe even re tape the box while i deplete my mass quantities to keep any curious pests out while i did get this econo bag version over the smaller version in order to save money buying online in itself was not in order to save money as two reviewers so far have noted whole foods when they have them will sell these bags individually or in bulk for a little less however that is probably the only reasonably priced thing in the whole building as one of my friends calls the place whole paycheck and which is why i do not shop there anymore that and also because i moved to a state where they do not have them so getting to a store which actually stocks this cereal is difficult to me amazon is free shipping mitigates the price to where it is at least a fair price close or even with whatever else your best deal would be especially if you factor in gasoline to make a special trip you might end up saving money but for me it is a time and fuel saver without paying more yes i had to purchase a lot but it will get eaten even if it takes me a looong time the upside is that i am not gonna run out anytime soon i have not had this cereal for a year since i moved i really missed it further product info it took me awhile to figure out the difference between nature is path heritage and grain cereals they look and taste similar and have very similar ingredients the biggest difference in my book is the use of kamut for heritage kamut is essentially a proprietary grain supposedly an extinct form of durum wheat obtained from ancient tombs in egypt this is disputed by some who believe it is a landrance or regional variation kind of like how a border collie is still a collie not a whole new breed regardless the importance to many consumers is the lack of genetic modification but kamut planting is strictly licensed and it is only allowed to be grown organically so there are extra costs and controls involved in other words it is more expensive or at least more involved for cereal makers to make stuff using kamut than just buying wheat off the open market interestingly nature is path charges exactly the same amount for both cereals so all other things being equal i choose heritage over grain because of the kamut further comparison grain has rice and corn which i consider to be almost fillers especially rice heritage has neither but has spelt and quinoa both very nice grains in my view grains is heavier on oats amazon doesn t list millet in the ingredients but it is in there a good thing it is listed in grain millet is an underrated grain too often associated only with cheap birdseed grain also has buckwheat heritage does not because of the near equal tradeoffs i used to buy both grain and heritage locally and mix them together bulk buying on amazon precludes this at the moment either way you can not lose i see amazon sells a puffed millet cereal it is cheap and i might ispike my mix with that i also hear amaranth will pop like popcorn i do not know if that would work for cereal grain are not as sweet as traditional cereals and it takes about seconds to get used to that and after that i find myself wishing it were even less sweet cane juice is the second ingredient in heritage but the fourth ingredient in grain ,1
we have tried other cereal bars and these are by far my toddler is favorite they are good quality and the amazon price is terrific ,1
absolutely natural tasting maple agave i adore real maple syrup and this measures up very very well highly recommended ,1

live now in california grew up in the windy city of chicago grew up with this soup when my mom was in a hurry its as good now as it was then really good product ,1
i have had there french vanilla and really enjoyed it whatever this product is i do not know it has a strong chemical smell that is over powering before you even get a chance to taste it it reminds me of a high school chemistry lab i tasted this coffee hoping maybe it would only smell i even closed my nose to get a taste trying to forgo the smell i drowned it with syrup pumps i used coffee mate till it was pale nothing helped i hav not thrown away the k cups yet but i cant figure i will ever use them unforgeablely i moved all the kcups from the original box once i got them so i never tried to return themdo not buy this plavor gloria jean in general is not bad though,0
who does not love chocolate who does not love chocolate milk and when the two comes together in a tasty breakfast cereal what is not to love breakfast is the most important meal of the day so you better eat right one thing though i do not know why anybody would want to buy this online it is comes out to free shipping i paid at a local store ,1

i was looking for a healthy snack that was low in calories but really tasty these are delicious and full of flavor they are very light and only calories for serving half the package if you happen to take a breath when putting one in your mouth watch out because you will get a wasabi attack in your nostrils if you have ever had a little too much wasabi on your sushi you will know what i mean these are so tasty and the only bad thing about them is that when i eat them i crave sushi these are very appetizing and i would recommend that you buy a single package first if you have never tried them if you have had nori snacks before and like the kick that wasabi gives you you will not be dissapointed in these these are amazing ,1
i bought this as a add on gift just something small to go along with other items i bought i did read other reviews and was still surprised at how small it was i was really disappointed once it was opened to find a very small amount of candy and chocolate inside of the boxes and most of the space is taken up by filler and i did not receive the chocolates pictured in the photo i would not buy again or as a signle small gift to give to someone presentation looks great but very disappointing on whats really inside the quality of the candy is good but it is very over priced for what it really is ,0
i am glad to see this is available again on amazon it is my favorite for sprinkling on top of thick chocolate chip cookies before baking just a touch adds some nice zing i imagine it would be fine for other desserts for which coarse salt works eg caramels though i have not tried those ,1

my year old adores these crackers i recently was very ill and could not get to the store to buy them for her so i purchased them from a my favorite things through amazon since the price was and because the picture looks like a big box of crackers i assumed i was in fact buying a big box of crackers wrong they were selling a little bag for shipping when i contacted the seller to complain they were unwilling to do anything for me thankfully amazon stepped in but really i think they should ban this seller from their site talk about price gouging ,0

the switch says that their sodas have no added sugar but it is a bit of a dodge because they add a ton of concentrated fruit juices apple grape and acerola join cherry fruit juices all that sugar totals a whopping grams in an oz can far more than say cocoa cola for the same volume the black cherry flavor however is tart and real and true and its yumminess transcends all that natural sugar the color is real too a lovely brick red with a hint of fruity opaqueness the carbonation is light and feels right all in all the switch black cherry is a real treat it tastes just like the cherries in the cherry pie i get at the diner sweet and rich with a lovely dose of tartness there is no false note in this big rich flavor at all the only downside is the cloying sweetness that creeps in the aftertaste grams of sugar is just too much if they had toned it down a bit this would be a much better product in my opinion ,1
this is some delicious dark chocolate with the perfect sugar to cocoa combination not too bitter from the cocoa and not too sweet from the sugar what is more it is organic vegan and fair trade certified i bought this in the bulk size not only because i love chocolate more than my family but also because a small serving of dark chocolate every day is supposedly good for your heart i cherish that moment each day be sure to really chew and grind the dark chocolate down to a liquid consistency to get the full flavor out your taste buds will thank you ,1
i like appletini is and this matches the flavor quite nicely it does have quite a chemically after taste if it is not very very cold i drank my first glass when i had just made it wrinkled my nose it was far too sweet and had a weird strong after taste but i put it in the fridge anyways and cold with ice it is a nice drink i dilute it more than the maker recommends i use half their drink and half sparkling mineral water it is a refreshing change from ice tea and lemonade and though our first taste was through amazon vine we will buy it again which is proof that it does work for us ,1
my yr old son tyler who is autistic and had to go on the gf diet likes them very much i found these cookies at liz healthfood in conway ar they taste almost like an oreo great cookie ,1

i ordered this and had it delivered in just a couple of days it is a wonderfully soft fine milled white rye flour exactly what i wanted but could not buy locally tablespoons of this white rye flour in my regular white bread recipe improved the texture and crumb a tremendous amount will buy from thepreparedpantry again thank you ,1
i really enjoyed this cereal and am looking forward to buying more they are corn flakes with a hint of honey and roasted nut sweetness and crunchiness i had also tried the crunchy nut roasted nut and honey the ones shaped like o is and that had much more of a roasted peanut taste which was not what i was looking for in a cereal although if you are a real peanut lover it would be right up your alley for just a bit of honey roasted nut taste i highly recommend the flakes ,1
liked it somewhat but a little bland would have liked more walnuts and fruits we did like the non sweetness which i always look for in cereal and other ,1
i really enjoy the taste of this honey it is delicious and strong but not overwhelmingly so my only minor complaint is that the containers arrived so sticky that i had to wash them all i do not recommend including this product in an order with other items that can not risk a little honey contamination despite this i will definitely order aunt sue is honey again ,1
these bunnies are my daughter is favorite special treat they taste good and do not contain a lot of filler ingredients annie is has good quality products and this is no exception we have tried all the flavors and think the berry is the best ,1
i was a bit hesitant ordering this because you have to buy so much at once but the bread is wonderful it is most wonderful toasted and freezes recovers well i remember dr oz standing on the oprah show holding a loaf of white bread and saying that as far as your body is concerned this is table sugar well this stuff isnt i will be buying much more in the years to come a great product high fiber high nutrition etc thanks ,1
there is not a ton you can say about these i used to buy large quantity bags of these different brand at the local sams club but my store decided to stop stocking them i thought i would turn to amazon as usual to find a replacement they arrived quickly seem to be of good quality and are rolled tightly one of these keeps my dog occupied for about an hour to an hour and a half he is a big dog before he is completely devoured it that is pretty good when compared to others i have bought i would definitely recommend these and will be back for more when this bag runs out ,1
when i first bought this item i loved it but after having it for a few months the biggest problem i have is starting the darn thing i will select my steam time i need and when i press start it beeps at me in problem shooting it says if it beeps then its not locked in but it beeps more then plus it does not even puree most stuff like green beans carrorts and apple sauce are some of the top ones i can think of ,0
today is happy day because i found this product at a health store and sense artificial sweeteners is not working anymore for me i went to truvia and i had to give up pop both regular and diet will no need to thanks to stevia there is diet pop i can still use and plus it tastes more sweeter and more real than those yucky chemicals plus i had no problems with it i was happy that i did not have to give up pop once again cheers to stevia for pop and truvia for being a enhancer taste of stevia and plus making are life is sweeter happy and finally healthier thank you for reading and you are more than welcome to leave a cheers comment to cheer for stevia ,1

essentia water has a ph of about a far cry from as stated on the bottle i added a little baking soda to get it to a higher ph that cost me what for the liter i will stick with purified water and getting it to the right ph myself with gmo free baking soda not sure why i purchased the bottle since good ph or not it is leading to an epidemic in this country and beyond ,0
these have been the best treats we have found yet they are low cal and the perfect size our puppy begs us for them even she knows where they are and goes and stands by them ,1
if you had not had bon bons you are missing out they are super sweet and powdery and also very chewy once you eat a couple of packages your mouth will get sore from chewing so much the oz bags contain bigger bon bons the size of jawbreakers or quarters as compared to the oz which is about the size of a dime my favorite candy all the way from france ,1
finally long after penrose just seemed to vanish of the face of the earth came this product that no others can even compare these are what real pickled sausages supposed to taste like i would recommend these to anyone ,1
i have tried many gluten free products on the market and this is by far the easiest and more yummiest product yet thank you betty crocker ,1
i go throug about boxes of these a month at least ,1
as somone who loves hot foods i was looking forward to my first taste of jolokia hot sauce imagine my suprise when i doused a tortilla chip with some holy jolokia i thought somone had slipped some dull tabasco or other innocuous sauce in place of the real thing it had some flavor but no more heat than the plethora of other middle heat sauces that claim to be hot the flavor was more like habanero only much tamer and to think this was developed be the univ of arizona is hot pepper research lab very disappointing ,0
i heard nothing but raves about this bar and how it tastes just like cherry pie ummm perhaps people need to eat more cherry pie because the cherry pie i am used to tastes nothing like these these tastes a lot more like someone doused a date and nut bar with sour cherry juice too tart and way too sweet ,0
got these on sale for roughly cents per cup which is half the price of my local grocery stores plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors these things are a great snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you can not escape for a real meal this is one of my favorite flavors of instant lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale ,1
i have four dogs two large and two small all different breeds i started on the wellness because of the king charles spaniel i inherited ate it well but now all of my dogs eat it and happily so it is worth the price to me because they seem so healthy and visits to the vet are kept to a minimum ,1
i have been drinking decaffeinated green tea for over years i have tried most brands available bigelow decaffeinated organic green tea is superior in taste conveniently packaged and by far my favorite ,1
delicious tea so good i bought packages at once also because it was a great low price at amazon minty subtle no bitter tea flavor ,1
i am not a vet so i can not say whether greenies are good for him but my dog loves these and amazon by far has the best price ,1
i really enjoy these cookies as a celiac with no tolerance for gluten in any form it is nice to finally find something that i truly enjoy that does not taste like cardboard ,1
there is not much to say so i will keep it simple this is a really good shampoo leaves my hair feeling very clean and detangles my hair it smells greatand feels very silky i have used it about different times now and i have enjoyed it i have natural course hair and it does help to soften my hair i approve ,1
bentley is assorted tea tins this is a good product i drink alot of tea since surviving terminal throat cancer in good tasting tea good flavor nice reusable tins i would prefer to buy one tin at a time instead of tins though amazon ships fast and so far trouble free ,1
the good bean variety pack so thinking this product would be crunchy and light i was surprised it had a different texture surprisingly nice the flavors are robust and delicious the texture is not hard on the teeth but still has a crunch but you can tell they are baked not cooked with oil giving off that oil cooked crunch i shared them with some other people who also thought they were very tasty and filling you know you are getting a good snack when you do not have to eat the entire pack and yet not putting on wasted calories i recommend this treat for those who love to snack but do not want to eat the wrong things two thumbs up ,1
new to the world of keurig i bought these k cups in a large package for my husband and i to share unfortunately we were very disappointed hot chocolate k cups are designed to quick dissolve compared to the regular hot chocolate packages you buy from the store and it tastes like chemicals the milk chocolate is no different than the dark chocolate when it comes to chemical taste after playing with different water level settings i eventually just had to throw them out now we buy normal hot chocolate packets instead ,0
i would like to start by saying that i have never written a review about food before but i must after tasting this bar harbor manhattan clam chowder it is by far the worst soup i have ever tried i know manhattan style is not supposed to be thick like new england but that is not the problem the problem is that this chowder has no taste to it whatsoever i did not think it was possible and i do not know how they could possibly remove all taste from their soup but they did i tried adding salt pepper tabasco just to try to pull some kind of flavor out of this did not work needless to say unless you like eating a soup that tastes like steam and tin i would avoid this one ,0
this is a very nice additive for your bottled water my kids had no problem adding it to their water whereas if i would given them a b vitamin to take they would have freaked out i have used the energy and the,1
the marzipan has a very strong flavor too strong why are there apricot kernels in it and it was too sweet ,0
this product is called by the manufacturer a water enhancer and boasts to give you vitamins and energy with an extra dose of vigor and with calories sugar and carbs with a fruit punch flavor from all natural flavors i was curious so gave it a try you are supposed to use one squeeze per ounces of water with this package holding servings depending on your squeeze time the drink will be weak just right or strong so you have to figure out how you like it it does taste like fruit punch and is sweet thanks to the sucralose the product is red colored thanks to red dye which some with dye allergies may like to know is present in this product as for vitamins it says it has of the rda for vitamin c and has mg or less of vitamin bs and taurine additives give electrolytes also the energy is thanks to the added natural caffeine mg per serving this is good for covering up the bad taste of tap water or if you just hate the flavor of plain water the best use of this for my family is to use it when my kids have no choice but to drink terrible tasting water while at boy scout camp add this to that awful hose water they use at camp and the scouts will drink the water provided and they will not only get hydrated but it adds some vitamins and electrolytes however my family does try to avoid artificial sweeteners in our daily life this product basically turns your water into an electrolyte and caffeine drink with flavor not unlike buying the sports drinks pre made except this is convenient to put into your own water in whatever container you use water bottle for bike ride or whatever you will save money by purchasing this instead of premixed energy drinks too i think this product has its place although there is still debate over the necessity of drinking electrolyte drinks while doing non extreme exercising vs drinking just plain water and some people will continue to debate whether sucralose should be a part of our daily diets and others seek to avoid food dyes i will stay out of the debate for my review the purpose of my review is to tell you what is in this product and how it tastes i will let you decide if this is something you want or need to use ,1
sweet aroma like mandarin peels slightly citrusy and green tea is good for you too good antioxidant great for the skin and some say it keeps fat away i drink this in the morning with honey before my singing lessons and many times in the evening to relax the throat with calm warmth ,1
my dog has allergies and this is the only chew product that he can tolerate wish i could find it in pet stores ,1
my daughter is in thee u s coast guard and is stationed in seattle it did not take long for her to find this product while visiting in seattle we went of course to pike street market and also of course bought a huge fillet of king salmon we planked it on her grill and used the rub with love salmon rub needless to say it was the best salmon that i ever had i have been having her send me a regular supply recently a new fish market opened here in my neighborhood in miami and they bring in fresh wild caughtalaskan salmon every other day at least twice a month i visit the bone island fish market get a nice filet of whatever salmon is in season apply lots of rub with love salmon rub and grill it on alder wood planks which are available here in miami at evenings delight grill and barbecue store i give this product a superlative rating ,1

clear scalp hair beauty therapy severely damaged my hair i had to wash it out three times the first time i shampooed it out then my hair was a tangled horrible mess it broke my hair as i gently tried to comb through it residue was still in my hair until the next time i washed it i then was able to get it out however by that time my hair was badly damaged and broken in places i feel it is my duty to warn you that if you have fragile hair you might want to stay away from this product stick with your favorites and do not try this just because it is inexpensive i have quite beautiful hair and i am sorry i tried this product ,0
great cereal obviously this can be found in almost every grocery store but i live in a very rural area so get this at a great price shipped to my door is wonderful ,1
the only other steel cut oats i have tried were quaker they were ok but i think i like these better they are cut into smaller pieces so they cook to the texture i like in a little less time cooking time is still about minutes i do not need gluten free so i do not know if it makes any difference in the taste or texture but for those with a need to avoid gluten this is the one to buy i add bob is red mill dried cranberries to these after they are cooked but still warm excellent ,1
my father has been drinking this tea for years its so good for you especially men ,1
i just started using my bio bags i have had compostable bags before and liked them these appear to be very similar love the fact that the compost bag makes it much easier to empty the compost pot i felt these bags were a good value and as long as they prove themselves during long term use i would buy then again ,1
product arrived sooner than expected and in perfect condition we had previously purchased this product from our veterinarian is office where it was much more expensive ,1
i always mix wild rice with other kinds of brown rice that take about the same time to cook so we do not need top quality for our purposes this is fine i usually order roland products when they have a or percent off deal and i would order this rice again on that kind of discount special ,1
i bought several flavors and this is the one i use the most it has a horribly bitter taste if it is not diluted quite a bit for example i tried to put a few drops on some sliced strawberries but had to just throw them away yech but i use it every day about drops in a oz bottle of water with some lemon slices and it is been great ,1
this product is not good and varies in consistency the taste runs from a faint chemical much like benzine to stale to an occasional nutty flavor i bought another brand at the same time to compare sweet gourmet no comparison spend the few extra dollars i have eaten about an half cup and i am tossing the gerbs ,0
i used to be a coffee drinker grind my own beans you know the drill i read an article about how beneficial green tea is and i decided to try this stuff i was surprised because it has a fruity aroma and with a dab of honey it is delicious i had tried green tea in the past and it tasted awful this stuff is good it is supposed to keep my blood pressure down so we will see ,1
i enjoy dark strong coffee like starbucks french roast and sumatra i do not enjoy coffees with a sweet tangy flavor such as dunkin donuts and gevalia to begin with the keurig brewer tends to brew a slightly less bold or strong coffee than traditional methods such as a french press or even slow drip so for me nothing other than extra bold k cups will do the trick in the keurig brewer the strength of the extra bold rainforest is strong enough for my taste could be even a litte stronger the flavor is slightly smoky and rich but also slightly bitter with an almost stringent chemically after taste this however is normally not noticeable i only notice it after immediately tasting another coffee gloria jeans black gold extra bold is smoother but also not as bold ,1
although i was looking for fat free gravy i did wonder how it would taste without any fat that is not your usual gravy by any stretch of the imagination gravy generally has a lot of fat whether it is chicken beef or turkey but my family is calorie conscious and i decided to give campbell is chicken fat free gravy a try when it arrived from amazon and i gave it a taste test i was delightfully surprised at its very good flavor i served it without announcing that it is fat free until i noticed that the family had enjoyed it and i even received compliments well cans are not staying around as long as i expected they might so i am ready to order another case opening a can with the pop top lid heating and putting it on the table has become a last minute thing buying by the case from amazon is a terrific deal campbell is fat free is not available in my area and there is only a generic available at one local supermarket costing for a oz can do not think i will bother taste testing that one the calorie count is per serving size cup that is even considered a free food on the ada and weight watcher is exchange lists the sodium count is a bit high at but i find that to be true in any prepared foods i must admit it does not have that golden color you get from chicken gravy that contains fat but i have solved that by occasionally adding a couple of drops of kitchen bouquet when it is meant to be ladled over potatoes rice etc i do not bother when using it in recipes all in all the flavor is good but it does not overwhelm the taste of the food it is going on or into ,1
great to hand out at halloween these rolls are big the size of a roll of lifesavers yummy gummies stock up folks ,1
very simple and delicious light taste of coconut when you do not want plain water this is really a treat best when cold ,1
decided to try this and should not have my wife and i both tried to drink a glass of it and ended up pouring it down the drain to us it tasted awful and had a strange consistency if you have never tried this see if you can buy one carton at your local supermarket to see if you like it or not ,0
i was diagnosed with celiac disease last spring and finding gluten free bread that tastes good has been nothing short of a nightmare i love this mix it is so easy and versatile i use it in my bread machine on the gluten free setting and add some extra time on the bake cycle to make sure it is done i also add about of honey to the wet ingredients to moisten it up a bit this bread makes delicious deli style sandwiches no more frozen bread for me ,1
oh my goodness i bit into this bar for the first time today and was transported to the heavenly realm or at least that is how it felt to me seriously some of the best chocolate i have ever had and sugar free too this stuff is so creamy and rich that one square is enough to put me on cloud nine thank you godiva ,1
thank god for the internet as i have only seen these mints in one store while visiting florida locally philly i have yet to see these in any store and believe me i have looked everywhere these are a great alternative to the overly powerful peppermints and the tastes too much like big red gum cinnamon mints these are strong but you do not get the burning tongue sensation with the urge to spit it out of all the altoid flavors this is most enjoyable of the lot if you like spearmints but never had the chance to try these i could not recommend them more these are now my mints of choice over polo mints and another of my favorites foxes mints now if we could just get stores to carry these maybe more people would learn how truly excellent they taste ,1
this is a great product received it very quickly with no problems and would buy again if u own a kreger you should try this it is good stuff ,1
i have had a few other instant fried noodles meals here and there but these unlike others really taste like real fried noodles very stout flavor perfectly done noodles perfect spicing and a really good lunch add a diced hamburger patty and a dash or two of pepper sauce and serve it on warm tortilla chips and it is a real meal this one is good thank you maruchan and thank you amazon ,1
these are exactly what they appear to be coffee pouches that are great for a little energy pick up each pouch is comparable to a cup of coffee ,1
after my redelivery date for another green tea brand lipton was coming up i was informed by amazon that it was not in stock and would not be for my delivery date so i looked for some other option so i saw this and on subscribe and save it was cheaper but it had great reviews so i decided to try it all i can say is wow the other brand of green tea tasted more like just regular tea and even looked like regular tea by regular i mean the popular cheap orange peoke tea you get in restaurants and such but this is actually green the flavor is nice and light not bitter i did not really care that it was organic i do not fall for that hype but i believe the tea plant is very hardy so it does not take much to make it organic as compared to other plants at the current price subscribe save it works out to per bag which is a heck of a deal throw in some ice and it is a great way to beat the summer heat needless to say i am not going back to the other brand after this ,1
box arrived in great shape the cookies are easy to make and they taste great they were fresh and scrumptious ,1
my wife bought me this sauce sampler for christmas knowing my love for bbq sauces and dipping sauces of all kinds most of the sauces were quite delicious but the best part is getting to try the several different styles i e texas brisket sauce versus carolina mustard based sauce i recommend this as far as taste and styles but the price plus shipping added in made it quite expensive ,1

however the dogs went crazy for these i will probably order more in the future if i can find a good deal fyi they are pig snouts so if you are squeemish petco did refund my money so all is good ,0
i can not even think of drinking any other coffee it is better than any specialty coffee from and shop or coffee house ca not be beat ,1
we recently found out that my year old son is allergic to gluten and casein and these cookies have been a lifesaver my son has a big sweet tooth and these hit the spot for him they have a great taste and he requests at least two every day the only reason i give it four stars instead of five is because the texture is a little different for my taste but it does not bother my son at all and that is all that matters thank you enjoy life for creating such a great product ,1
these coffed pods are not a good value for the money they are somewhat bitter in taste and do not fit the senseo machines correctly i will not purchase this brand again ,0
i would been hearing about the product for a couple of years and finally ordered some but inadvertantly ordered lite yuk after much anticipation waiting for it is arrival and then finally opening up the cheap plastic jar and putting some on a piece of bread to try it with it tasted like wall spackle ok i have never eaten wall spackle but i am pretty sure it tastes like lite baconnaise then i realized after careful examination of the label that i ordered the lite dammit determined to finally taste the original baconnaise i went back on amazon and very carefully ordered the original baconnaise and it is pretty dang good i will leave a review of the original non lite product there ,0
i have an english mastiff and an english bulldog both breeds are known for their sensitive digestive systems from a puppy our mastiff has been very food sensitive and our bulldog has gas issues big suprise i know anyhow both of the dogs love this food not only does it show in their eating habits and weight but also in the amount of waste as well as their coats they look just amazing they have been eating the taste of the wild brand for about months now and we are sold on it the pricing is very good especially if you have amazon prime i pay less than i would in the store and have those large bags just waiting at the door for me instead of having to lug them into my bug and believe me with two dogs one being a large breed you cant beat that convenience i urge you to take a look at their nutritional facts i think you will be happily suprised ,1
i have been eating quaker oatmeal most of my life and the maple syrup and brown sugar version of their instant oatmeal breakfast is one of my favorites it is simple to make either add hot water or microwave it i tend to microwave it which tends to give the oats more body it has the right mix of syrup and sugar taste and i do not need to add anything at all for taste just love this as an anytime snack ,1
my sister received her basket quickly and she was elated and happy definitely recommend this basket to all diabetics or anyone looking for a healthier selection via a gift basket thanks so much ,1
this was the first time i would had it and love it just wish i could find locally ,1
i love carr crackers and was excited when i saw i could get them through amazon but crackers are fragile and while most of them arrive intact there are times that i get cracker crumbs instead of crackers this is not carrs fault or amazon is fault but it is still disappointing ,1
my loves these and i do too with a little help holding the pouch she can drain one of these pretty quickly through the straw cap so we do not need to worry about bowls and spoons when we are out although if you want to use a spoon the travel spoon tip that boon makes for plum organics fits the cap on these also these are a little expensive for everyday but when we are going out i love that i can just throw a couple of them into the diaper bag then there is the fact that they are organic healthy without added sugar and in bpa free packaging and my daughter really likes the taste if i could give them stars i would ,1
i have so far ordered them times and always have liked them you get them on amazon at the same price you pay for them at any indian grocery store which is unlike any other indian dessert that you find on amazon price is one of the reasons we keep buying them from amazon followed by convenient shopping from amazon ,1
i have purchased several of the st dalfour products and all are worth it i take them for lunch when hiking or kayaking as well as just at home when i want something fast light and easy a terrific product ,1
i have been eating these seeds for years now and i can not keep enough of them around home or work if you like spicy snacks try these you will not be sorry ,1
this is a strong quality mate the mint flavor is faint perhaps due to the use of spearmint instead of stronger peppermint a personal preference yet it is just enough to add a pleasant cooling effect to the mate bitterness and earthiness ,1
this is great cat food i recommend it highly the only flavor i do not use from the instinct canned products is the chicken all the others are a part of our rotational feedings and my cats love it they were addicted to an additive that is used by other commercial producers once we got past that problem we have not had any issues since my cats are home and healthy because of this wet cat food ,1
though this is my first k cup review let me establish my position and reasons i came to this conclusion first i am coffee wimp i drink coffee only with half half fat free and imitation sugar second my has not yet arrived so i used my krups model espresso machine to brew my k cup which is not all that different than the brewing process of the keurig machines third i gave up drinking all drinks made up or including alcohol in due to health reasons but prior to that time i had drank white russians and was very fond of them i just can not remember exactly what kahlua tasted like except it was sweet and i enjoyed them forth wither one likes or dislikes one k cup over another is purely subjective and i am not criticizing those who wrote negative review with that established lets move on when i opened the kahlua k cup i noticed a distinct sweet aroma and also a dark roasted bean odor like one might experienced from a starbucks coffee so being from seattle washington i am use to that i pealed off the lid of the k cup and emptied it into the krups filter basket tampered it down sightly like one would do for an espresso grind measured about ounces of water and poured that into the machine and then turned it on when the coffee started to drip into the carafe and some steam arose i was not sure wither to hold my breath or hold my nose much to my surprise i did notice an odor like from a dark roasted bean or from my espresso is i use to make but nothing offensive i was a bit perplexed again i thought of the reviewers who had complained of an offensive odor emitting from their machines during the brewing process upon completion of the brewing cycle i poured the coffee in my large mug added the half half until it reached a blond carmel like color but not enough to over power the coffee and the sweetener and took my first sip with great anticipation not bad was my first impression i actually enjoyed it it had a sweet but not to sweet flavor and to my mind a carmel like flavor with a medium dark roasted base of a regular coffee no offensive taste or aroma others had written about and a pleasant after taste that lingered for some time after wards not to strong nor acidic quite pleasant actually my conclusion perhaps the other reviewers had a bad batch or this particular flavor needs to be consumed with some cream or cream like dairy product and or a sweetener either way i plan to continue on drinking this k cup flavor for some time and can not wait till tomorrow to have my next cup when my arrives and i have a different result with that machine i will add an update ,1
i bought these from costco because they were on sale and looked interesting i ended up going back and buying boxes my whole family loves them plain or withpeanut butter i eat them daily ,1
my cats love this food and create quite a rumble when i open it up i give this to them as an evening treat and give them blue buffalo dry food in the morning and along with the salmon this product is not a complete cat food it is strictly salmon so be sure you feed them a complete food along with it ,1
i received this box for my birthday and the candy tasted stale like it was stored in somebody is basement and the soda was flat the pop rocks were melted into a single gooey mess and some of the packages were wet ,0
with all the nonsense about pet food recalls and melamine it is important to know where your pet food originates this food does not originate in china and contains no wheat gluten the chicken pot pie is a bit too watery to me so one star down however watery is not necessarily bad as it provides additional hydration for cats that eat dry food all three of my cats do eat dry food nutro i like to provide them with moist food on the side to encourage their appetite and hydration i am frankly scared of most canned foods available because of the melamine thing the cheap ones have ingredients almost always originating in china and the expensive ones are not cost effective for me to provide as a snack this food does fill that gap in that it averages a dollar a can through amazon less through subscribe and save and it contains high grade human grade ingredients i thought about putting my cats on a raw food diet barf for cats it is messy requires counter space time and storage space for ingredients and the finished product therefore i try to get the best dry food i can and supplement it with canned food like this all three cats liked both varieties of food cats cans once a day the dry food is at will they munch on that when they like so far so good no increased mess in litter box from soupy ingredients either their appetites remain strong for both this wet food and their dry food ,1
this juice is not touted as a cure it is listed as a supplement to help people with their illnesses when the medicines just can not do enough i have been using it for several months now and although my asthma is not gone it is not worse and is more under control my husband is creaky knees do not hurt anymore my year old mom can walk without pain in her joints now no we did not stop our medicines yet but this is an all natural juice that helps ,1
i really like this product for the simple reason that it has a good chicken taste mix one pouch with a cup of water and compare the taste with canned stock there is no comparison savory choice wins hands down ,1
king is hawaiian rolls are my family is all time favorite rolls i do not even bother buying regular dinner rolls we just buy king is hawaiian they are good with meals and just by themselves as a quick snack the kids like them because they are sweet soft and moist we adults do also i admit the meal sometimes calls for something more bland not so sweet but we do not care because we love them so much just excellent ,1
this is wonderful cinnamon it is so much better than the regular ground cinnamon we find in our every day stores in the u s this ceylon cinnamon is not bitter like the regular cinnamon i recommend everyone at least try this indus organic ceylon cinnamon powder i will be ordering more because my husband and i love it ,1
my mother insists on using washington rich brown seasoning in her spaghetti sauce and has passed this down to myself and my daughter it is not an easy product to find in my area so i was thrilled to be able to order it on amazon ,1
after trying several packages of the signature blend all with different product codes i found these t discs to be defective most of the grounds ended up in the bottom of my cup and the rest spewed all over my coffeemaker i notified gevalia over a month ago and they have not offered any explanation or solution to this problem i have not had this problem with any other brand of t disc or other gevalia blends it is extremely frustrating considering i am paying extra for the gevalia name i would recommend maxwell house or seattle is best being far superior in the t discs with no grounds in the bottom of your cup ,0
if you can not take the time to make your own or you are just not a cook this is the best sauce ever i am a certified personal chef i cannot say enough about this sauce it is rich flavorful and has just the right amount of seasoning you can use it ways by the way all the scarpetto sauces are fantastic ,1
i started my black lab on the wellness brand because i did some research and found that this is one of the best the seller got my order sent to me within days and the packaging was done so well that there was not a single little ding in any of the cans and not even a rip on the can labels order from this seller great prices and you will not be disappointed ,1
the clif kids twisted fruit rope is a great product it can replace those nasty fruit flavored roll ups and fruit snacks that are made primarily of corn syrup and artificial color and usually no fruit at all the twisted fruit rope is made out of actual furit and even provides one serving per rope the ingredients are simple apple puree apple juice concentrate makes it sweet flavors pectin and fruit and vegetable colorings none of the chemicals from those bright fruit flavored concoctions and everything is organic the taste is great too it is a bit tart but with a nice berry flavor the texture is chewy and it looks tastes and feels like a big twizzler the ropes are packaged individually to throw in lunch boxes or backpacks but i found myself reaching for at least at a time there are a couple of things i did not like the strips are a little sticky it helps if you hold them by the wrapper instead of taking them out the sugar is also still fairly high there are grams of sugar a whopping out of each gram rope it is not added refined sugar but the sugar comes from apple juice concentrate which is much sweeter than natural apple juice combine that with the sticky nature of the product and it is probably a good idea to have your kids rinse their teeth after eating one those drawbacks aside these snacks remain far superior to candy or those gooey little fruit snacks as a tasty treat for kids or adults keep in mind actual fruit is always a better choice but if you need something portable these are a great option ,1
after reading the reviews i was excited to try these bars everyone had positive things to say about this and all the other flavor larabars unless you love date paste from the fruit you will hate these bars they are exactly that chocolate flavored date paste they are the worst gluten free food i have ever tried i thought that these bars compared to the fruit ones would at least be more chocolate y than fruity nope they taste horrific there is not even any positive comment i can make about these bars if you like the bars save your money buy date paste and just eat it gross ,0
here my findings it tastes very salty so be careful how much you use also be aware that it looks like sugar so if you plan in not storing it in its original package mark it carefully fun aside kosher salt is dried sea salt it can be a bit deceitful if you have a recipe that calls for spoon measured salts look up how much ounces fit on a spoon and weigh it kosher salt comes in bigger crystals then normal salt means bigger volume with less actual salt so be sure you measure accordingly there is nothing else i can tell you ,1
i first had this at the disney is grand floridian resort they no longer carry it in their tea room unfortunately but i am glad i can enjoy it at home if you love cinnamon this is the tea for you ,1

i have fallen in love all over again for months i have eaten salads constantly just to have an excuse to use this dressing no joke for awhile there i was sneaking shots of salad dressing just for that glorious pop of flavor wow i did end up going with the cheaper non zesty and that is good too especially if you pump up the vinegar a little but the zesty is where it is at it is definitely the magical taste of my youth and has singlehandedly addicted me to salad highly recommended ,1
update the original packaging design has indeed been fixed i highly recommend their coffees no more coffee shop brand for me only brooklyn roastery brands like others have mentioned here coffee is quite good when the k cups work i have a box of recieved the end of may so far of the kcups either clogged up my keurig or shot out coffee all over the counter top or give you a cup of coffee grinds when you put one of these kcups in the machine it may or may not work very poor packaging standards ,1
i take this stuff before going to the gym it gives me the boost of a pre work out drink and makes me sweat like crazy at the gym ,1

if you like all in one meals then velveeta cheesy skillets is one you should try i bought the already cooked sliced chicken in the meat section to add in pros of the meal cheesy flavorful i did not need to add any other seasonings it did not require any salt pepper or whatever else your tastebuds may call for the servings were plentiful it serves a family of four perfectly there were only in my house but we had enough for lunch the next day the leftovers were just as tasty as the first night of eating it the only con that i can think of is that the meal uses dried broccoli which has a strong sweet taste if you are able to substitute it with fresh broccoli or even frozen broccoli that would balance the taste better ,1
fast dependable service from the onlinecandyshop product arrived in perfect delicious condition i am a satisfied customer and will do business with this vendor again thank you jan denke,1
made these brownies for the first time today and they have got to be the worst boxed brownie i have ever had horribly artifical tasting and the frosting that comes with them makes them ten times worse my advice is choose a different brand of box brownie or make your own i tried to take the easy way out instead of making my own big mistake glad i was not serving these to company so much for premium brownie mix ,0
i was surprised that elsa which makes glorious balsamic vinegars passed off the poor ingredients in this bottle as being worth one whiff and one taste told me this is not the real thing it contains caramel coloring and wine vinegar just like balsamic from the supermarket if taylor is had agreed to refund the return shipping i would have been satisfied after all it is always a risk to buy online but i feel that their product is actually deceptive and taylor is should have taken responsibility ,0
this is the only popcorn i eat i like that it has even less salt and the low salt popcorn it is always fresh and flavorful if you want lower fat content and less salt without loss of flavor than this is the popcorn for you orville redenbacher is natural simply salted less fat is the only popcorn to buy amazon com is the only place i am able to find this product so i am glad amazon com has it available ,1
i did not like this jerky at all i read other reviews and decided to try it however the bag i received was very soft and sweet i realize that it is called sweet n spicy but it was not spicy at all the sweetness was overpowering i prefer at dryer jerky also this was so soft that you could bite right through it i am used to jerky that is tougher i know i will never purchase this brand again ,0
after trying multiple formulas we finally found a formula that my son tolerates does not spit up a doctor had said that he was suffering from mild reflux which i did not fully believe and we tried a rice formula and he would spit almost half of it back up trusting my instinct i decided to research organic formulas and found earth is best you do need to mix it with warm water in order for it to fully dissolve and shake well you do not get a lot of excess foam with the shaking i have not had any issues with it at all now that he is been eating solids i cook his food but buy earth is best jarred food for hard to find fruits and veggies ,1
i was excited to try this tea as i love both matcha green tea and chocolate i do not like this product i usually order my matcha from matcha source out of la and i guess i have been spoiled because the quality of this green tea seems low and combined with the chocolate flavor is undrinkable to me i will be using the rest of the bag in smoothies and hope it will drown out this awful taste ,0
great product have used this brand for years will not use anything but braggs when you have found the best why go anywhere else,1
i bought these tomatoes after i read an article about canned tomatoes that said they were bad for you the acidity leaches stuff out of the tin these are great tomatoes not quite as choppy more pureey than i am used to but that is ok at oz i find i need to freeze about of the container for most recipes ,1
my month son loves these but off late i am making home made purees inspired by super baby food book however these are very handy and convenient for travel purposes,1
i fell in love with love crunch at the first bite i have had many flavored granola products and some even contained bits of berries but i have never before had one that contained whole dried berries as well as actual chunks of chocolate the taste was so great that i was absolutely sure it had to be terrible for me but that is not the case at all for dark chocolate and red berries blend the serving size is cup and each serving has calories from fat fat saturated cholesterol sodium potassium carbs and protein it felt very decadent on yogurt or even just eaten alone altogether it was an excellent treat ,1
i absolutely love coconut water i do not drink a ton of regular water a day so i use this to supplement my intake i drink one ounce box a day it makes a real difference in my skin and hair as well much more moisterized and hydrated it also keeps me a little more regular this is chock full of benefits i give my month old of it when he seems constipated my pediatrician agreed it was a good idea do your research i was sorry to see that the oz boxes were not available on the prime shipping program now i order oz boxes on autoship look into it once you try coconut water you will never want to be without ,1
in character and consistency i think the best way way to describe these is to say that they are mid way between a regular corn tortilla chip and a wheat thins cracker though there is in fact no wheat in the ingredients lightly salted with just a hint of sesame very tasty and very snack able the one ounce bags though they may at first glance seem packaging intensive are a good idea if you had a big bag of these in front of you it would take significant will power to stop after just one ounce the small bags are a crutch for those of us who lack self control another plus the bag proclaims in bold type no trans fat no cholesterol no preservatives no gmo genetically modified organism ingredients no artificial colors and no artificial flavors of your daily fiber and just of your sodium too i had them with a cold beer and felt like i was eating an oxymoron these are a delicious but natural snack well worth the calories they cost ,1
so i have been hanging with a top player at the world series of poker and i purchased packages of jacks links beef jerky these purchases were the worst possible way to spend my money the meat was so dry i was not sure if i was eating dried rat tail or beef jerkey the meat caused sickness and lock jaw jacks links is as good as scraps off leather shoes it was pretty incredible of them to sponser the wsop but provide poor quality food at a ridiculous price ,0
i love these for lunch and quick dinners add a salad or veggies for a great meal ,1
this is a great product one of my cats needs to take medicine every other day and she likes the pill pockets so much that i give her one even on the days when she does not get medicine ,1
i just received my order of canned red head wild sockeye salmon few minutes ago and could not wait to taste it and wow my kind of taste of real salmon i have been looking for this taste of canned salmon for a while and i am happy that i finally found it delicious ,1
this company has excellent customer service very nice to do business with i emailed them and they got right back always with kindness like they really did care,1
i ordered this formula after carefully researching several of the organic brands one thing that is a deal breaker for me is corn syrup in baby formula the ingredient list here and on the formula is own website says nothing about corn syrup but low and behold on the can corn syrup solids well organic corn syrup solids which to me is no better skip this if you do not want corn syrup in your baby is formula but if it does not bother you you can find other brands with corn syrup for less than this one i will be returning it ,0
i used this for my first child after going back to work only two weeks later i noticed i was not producing what he was consuming at day care a few months later i started drinking two bags making cups i use the bag twice it helped to increase the milk within two or so weeks that was years ago i noticed the same thing happening with my second child she was drinking to bottles at day care and i was only pumping bottles maybe if i was lucky i need a frozen supply which i had but it was slowly decreasing i asked my dh to pick some more up at the grocery store the next time he went i work a lot and i only drink two tea bags a day using each bag twice in a new hot water cup this makes cups easy if not as i did the first time around i started this again last monday and do not need it on the weekend as she is usually content with what she is nursing off of today i have pumped since noon when i normally only get oz big difference and much needed hopefully this will increase a little bit more so i can give her what she needs at day care and put an occasional bottle in freezer for the weekends or emergency use i would highly recommend this product ,1
nice amount of heat and smoke very tasty chip that goes great with a brew ,1

i have never been much of a soup person unless down with a cold or too tired to cook up something fancy once heated i crumbled tortilla chips on top or even some shredded cheese since i love mexican food this satisfied me for the evening i was advised by progresso that they have discontinued this soup thank goodness amazon had some for purchasing ,1
i use this product daily and it has significantly helped me in reducing the occurrence of the commom cold will continue to buy this product and recommend emergenc ,1
i have purchased this directly at two different whole health food stores but found it easier and probably cheaper to order it on line it arrived intact and on time ,1
i am not a coffee drinker english breakfast tea is the next best thing i drink it every morning for some get up and go the tea keeps well in each count box this is my bulk buy of twinings english breakfast tea you can also take some to work with you so you can hook everyone else i started to go through count boxes too fast so i had to stop taking it to work ,1
we ordered this pasta after seeing it on dr oz my husband is such a pasta lover and very picky about his pasta neither of us were expecting much as it seemed too good to be true but i thought it was worth the chance we were both surprised and delighted with fibergourmet spaghetti it is well worth the price it takes a little longer to cook al dente than regular pasta as we usually buy thin pasta but for the nutritive value and calorie savings it is just amazing this has now become our pasta of choice and i am on the email notice list for the penne ,1
i hate oatmeal except in cookies with chocolate chips but i love this stuff really good tasting the price is good that is it matches what i would pay for this item on sale in a grocery store so that makes it a very good value also ,1
i really like this cookie but very confused about whether it is vegan or not amazon has listed in the ingredients milk but also says that it is vegan product website says it is vegan ,1
so my mom often buys bags of kitty treats for her grandkitten and i find it so hilarious that if it isnt the temptations treats in the yellow bag he will not touch them we can mix different brands together in a pile and he will pull the temptations treats out with his paw and leave the others its unreal either they just hit the jackpot with the perfect cat seducing ingredients or they have some sort of addictive substance in them who knows i only give them stars because they are not the healthiest treat for a cat but honestly he just loves them so much i cant say no ,1
we used to pick this product up retail but it seems all three stores we patron stopped selling it within the same week i suspect collusion on their part anyways i was thrilled to find that amazon not only offers the kit but at a subscribe and save discount some have mentioned that you could piece this together yourself cheaper better healther and that is a valid point but one thing you cannot buy in a store i have looked is the old el paso somewhat spicy cheese sauce that you cover the top tortilla with without this sauce the kit is worthless it is a great balance of spice and salty cheese and comes out so smooth when baked i usually separate the bottom two and top two layers of my portion i eat the bland er bottom layers first with frank red hot sauce and save the top layers for last since this concentrates the cheese flavor even further this is also a good dish to experiment with adding some black or pinto means to stuff the layers more or whatever shredded cheese might be lying around the fridge is a great way to increase it is yield and flavor between me and my girlfriend we split one of these for a meal it is probably our entire sodium intake for the day in one meal maybe but i can see how adding some sides like refried beans and rice would let us feed our family of when the time comes luckily the little ones are still at the formula baby food stage so we can hog it all overall if you have not tried it yet and as such are not addicted to the cheese sauce make it with your own ingredients if your already hooked then this is likely the cheapest way to get your fix p s i do have to mention that the s s price did just jump up about in one month from to but at almost a piece retail the price still comes out better from amazon ,1
this was my second purchase of this tea i found the quality higher than the name brand i had been drinking with far less dust and debris its a bit stronger too requiring less per pot ,1
this mix makes wonderful chewy brazilian cheese rolls be sure to knead the dough well roll tightly into small rolls and bake thoroughly serve hot as they are not as good cold i do not have any problem getting them all to disappear as soon as they come out of the oven they are just that good the best thing i have found to satify that craving for bread that is gluten free ,1
for canned food fancy feast is the only thing my cat eats shed rather starve than eat anything organic my cat devours this stuff within minutes she particularly loves the beef after checking the ingredient list though im wee bit alarmed for the regular grilled line poultry or beef is listed as the first ingredient followed by broth liver or fish then meat by product these gravy ones has broth as the first ingredient followed by poultry or beef and has a higher percentage of gluten hence the gravy i guess it sure taste good to my cat but it is like more like junk food than a healthy meal the kitty will not get these on a regular basis anymore regular grilled variety is better for her health suscribe and save is such an awesome deal it comes out to cents a can my local walmart used to have fancy feast for cents tax no more now its cents ,1
i ordered this because it is not always available in my grocery stores and my husband really likes this and some of my recipes call for this my husband grew up in england and it was common there ,1
how in the world do they get away saying all natural kosher ingredients in the description amazon should review their features and make them change their ingredient high fructose corn syrup a processed sugar substitute linked to type ii diabetes ,0

i am usually a fan of amy is organics they provide a reliable gluten free product that i can easily adapt to my needs in my kitchen canned foods are never an end product but a stepping stone toward a lovingly crafted meal however in this case the can might be beyond my skills of adaptation cumin did we have a cumin spill in amyland my dear sweet unnamable gods in heaven one bite of this chili has the most cumin i have ever had in one bite probably in one meal maybe one lifetime this is the cuminiest of cuminy chilis all other flavors cower in dread of the sheer cumininess of amy is organic southwestern black bean chili cumiiiiiiiiin it might have beans i do not know they could be giant lumps of cumin for all i can tell it is probably free of pesticides however my kitchen is organic produce borne fruitflies are afraid to near my bowl of this if it has not got pesticides it is certainly an effective pest repellant and i am considering rubbing it all over my chili starved body before i go out to the mosquito clouded weber to grill up some real food it is touted as vegan which is not really a selling point for me after the first taste of this chili has passed my tongue the remainder of the can will never brave the touch of flesh again back to the kitchen amy check the smudged details of your recipe real close try a milliliter ml instead of a barrel bbl and i will try this one again ,0
seriously i would never buy another canned tomato product that includes all the italian marzanos i have used this in tuscan beans marinara sauce with fresh ripe tomatoes and pizza ,1
my cats really do not eat this brand with much relish like they did when wellness had the mylar bags we really miss those bags the food just seemed to taste better to my cats canned they will not touch any flavor but i have had out of in a case smell off and even the dogs will not touch it so just check yours jik what has happened to this brand they were the best years ago ,0

i found this water for the first time at the philadelphia airport and bought a bottle for a long flight across the country as soon as i tried it i wished i had bought a few i wanted to cut out sugary drinks from my diet and get to drinking more water but have such a sweet tooth this was the perfect drink you are still getting the benefits of drinking water but with a little bit of sweetness to it very satisfying even my husband who has no tolerance for artifical flavors and was born without a sweet tooth loved it glad to see amazon has it readily available now i am hooked absolute favorite drink ,1

i have used this fancy feast turkey kitten food for three kittens whom i have rescued over the past several years i first purchased a few cans at petsmart when i adopted a little rescue black and white adorable kitty about three years ago his name was trouble and he came to me as a skinny undernourished little guy he was six months old but looked only two and a half or three months i could not find any variety in kitten food right then so trouble thrived on turkey feast and dry food he fattened up and seemed to get healthier and healthier but turned out to be immunosuppressed and i could not keep up with his vet bills so a kind vet is assistant took him from me well there i was catless again so i adopted another little guy who was rescued fom a drainage ditch that is my trnity he was a scrawny little piece of fuzz when i took him home got him some fancy feast turkey and some kibble and he too fattened up and his short litte hair grew long and graceful he is a small cat only lbs but he grew up on this food and i think it did well by him he is a slim little rascal with no added fat but plenty of spunk he progressed on to other fancy feast meals but still once in a while enjoys a can of kitten food his sister gabriella was a surpise to trinity and to me i dropped by the humane society while out and about one day and found an adorable underfed brown tipped ticced kitten she had been tick dipped but still carred the carcasses of dead fleas and ticks when i took her from the facility her owner said she was four mo but she only weighed lbs off i went for more turkey kitten food i do wish they would make it in more flavours plus i sneaked in some pro plan kitten food on her too but it was very expensive and she got mostly turkey she is now the pound alpha cat of the house and grew well on this kitten food somebody dumped a pregnant female kitty in our neighborhood and a friend took her in oh my she had a litter of six and i will be the proud mommie and cat lady when to of those babes come to my house in days sure enough i knew they were on their way so this time i let my fingers do the shopping at amazon and turkey feast is here also some proplan but turkey feast will dominate because of cost and past wonderful experience kittens love this stuff and they go from undernourished to well fed in two or three weeks my new guys will be the first i have had that are well fed from the get go but the will be turkey feast kitten babies since it has done so well for me in the lives of so many kitties i certainly recommend it the kittens thrive and the price is low it is a great deal ps new kittens have arrived one all black and one a brown tiger they go for the turkey food and gobble most of it right down in one sitting one three oz can for the two of them and on this wet food the poop does not smell bad that is a big plus they are also getting some pro plan food but the remains are smellier than the turkey will be giving it a try also ,1

i tried this product looking for a tasty almond butter after trying several other brands that were a waste of money i discovered this one it has excellent flavor plus there are no hydrogenated oils added to it a clear cut winner do not need to search further i have found the one i will be purchasing from now on excellent that it comes in packets portion control a good thing or i would eat too much out of the jar ,1
before i decided to purchase this product i looked around who has the best price and the winner was here none of the other stores online and physical once had this infant formula for an affordable price this formula is my son is favorite,1
it is very filling satisfying and has an excellent taste i have put apples and mangoes on top and that is delicious glad to see that it is offered at organic supermarkets warehouses and amazon ,1
do not fool yourself into thinking friskies is nutritious but hey your cat will love it this stuff is fast food for felines cheap fatty and apparently delicious my usually finicky bengal goes nuts when i open a can i used to bust out the friskies solely as a reward or a technique for getting her to eat the healthier food by mashing it all together in one bowl but she is winning that particular war she will literally eat her way around the healthier fare best if used sparingly but judged on the basis of feline enthusiasm it is a winner ,1
this tortellini is dry and grainy and comes in small boxes i could not eat it the flavor was very strong but not very good i ended up donating all remaining boxes ,0

i was concerned about having a live plant shipped to me but it was shipped quickly and packaged well i waited days then repotted the plant in a container i have had it weeks and it is doing well it has even grown a new leaf i did notice however you can not place this plant in full sun no matter how long this will cause the leaves to burn also if the plant gets too dry it will warm you by curling the leaves thanks hirts for a beautiful plant even if it never gives me bananas it is a gorgeous plant ,1

this is my first order of sesame oil after reading hearing of ayurvedic medicine practiced in india for thousands of years i purchased this to use on my skin and also cook some vegetables in and otherwise ingest as well as the benefits reported are numerous on both counts what i have learned thus far in relation to the benefits for the skin are as follows summarized briefly sesame oil has antifungal and antibacterial properties as well as what you may expect as to moisturizing the skin as it is a naturally occurring oil in the environment i really wanted organic cold pressed oil and this product did not say either but i bought it anyway to try out since it is my first try i have read it is great for athlete is foot and even toenail infections acne and other skin conditions including dandruff psoriasis do a search on the benefits of sesame oil you will get a great deal of hits including lance armstrong is site livestrong as there are also reported benefits of halting cancer growth i do not believe i can include links here which will not be edited out so you will have to check those on your own internally there are also benefits to your gi system and organs in general this seems a great all purpose solution to many issues we currently have in this western society of the usa i am excited to see what benefits i will experience while using this to me new method of healing with food now having explained why i purchased it in the first place let me say that this particular product is of the darker variety and has a very strong burned nut odor to it nevertheless i did apply it to my hands arms legs and feet yesterday evening and allowed it plenty of time to soak in it was not greasy anymore for me just before bed so i left it on slept with it overnight as i expected with any oil i may have used i woke up with soft smooth skin that felt nourished not dry itchy in winter months as usual and i am in florida so i imagine those in colder climates may enjoy those particular benefits even more i also wanted to use this for my son is acne years of age but it smells so badly to him that he would not allow that all in all i am glad i made the purchase am beginning this new regimen though i do wish i had held out for the cold pressed organic oil instead which i hear does not have such a strong odor i am hoping that the benefits will still be realized however as i now have quite a bit of oil here to use on a daily basis it was packaged very well within amazon is shipping box and arrived very quickly as most of my items do but in fairness i have the prime membership with shipping the outside of the box was labeled glass which confused me but worked nevertheless for handling as it arrived perfectly preserved as it should be ,1

first a couple of minor negatives with these cookies first is the name for years nabisco advertised a cookie is just a cookie but newtons are fruit and cake why the nabisco marketing gurus would think that it was a good idea to associate the newtons name with these thin crisp cookies is beyond me next is the packaging the trend today is toward recycled content paperboard packaging such as the one nabisco used for their new,1
item is as described and at a great price vs in store yum gf loves them ,1
this is a great bowl for my pets water it is not heavy it holds a lot of water when placed outside neither the bowl or the water get hot which is what i did not like about the metal bowls ,1
this is great to use to keep your dog busy for a while my terrier loves it ,1
well reviews for this drink are all over the place so i can not say my review is definitive anyway this drink met with negative results here too sweet and rich but it would be best to judge for yourself or look at several reviews for me not being a regular coffee drinker i prefer a cold coca cola or iced tea rather than any iced coffee drink anytime plus at about for a can too expensive for me but i am a cheapskate so keep that in mind ,0
they absolutely loved it even though they were picky with it for the first or days i had to stop ordering it because of price i am a college student as it is a bit expensive i will consider ordering it again for them when i can afford to ,1
used this to spray a castle cake nordic ware castle bundt pan it looked really great and everyone was impressed and it was wicked easy i blocked off the castle door so it would not get sprayed and would retain its chocolate color it seemed a bit more realistic that way oh and i did not notice any distinguishable flavor and no one complained which my family would feel free to do ,1
i am caucasian with hair i tried several mixed with conditioners amla dr bonners etc i fould this works best all buy itself mixed as the directions tell you to mix otherwise it was hard to rinse and made my hair texture feel funny and kinda dry when i did the simple mix as recommended on the box my hair was silky and shiny ,1
where do i start my son can not have enough of it he completely loves the taste of the mango on this pouch for those who are afraid of the taste of kale the mango and apple flavors overpower it making it easier for those picky eaters to have their vegetables i love the fact that is not artificial flavors or coloring in their product also i never knew about salba but what an amazing product ,1
the pods arrived fresh and quickly after ordering them by ordering the coffee through the subcription program they are a good value the flavor is good nice medium hazelnut flavor slightly bitter after taste to this brand of coffee ,1
just what the title says what more can you say i will buy again and again and again bubbles form just fine ,1
i think they call these easy cajun because there is essentially no spicy heat but being a capsicum super taster i am completely fine with that these cashews are roasted the right amount not too much and they are coated with a spice mixture that gives them a lot of fantastic flavor natural with no corn syrup no food coloring the coating stays on the cashews so there is little if no powdery residue another reason these are great for serving at parties in the car and on the run ,1
my husband and i first received this coffee as a gift and we have been buying it ever since the blend is extremely smooth without any bitterness bite or that jittery caffeine feeling we buy whole bean and the beans are always perfectly roasted and very fresh and the value for the two pound bag is amazing this coffee compares very comparably even with some of the so called jamaican blue mountain coffee the stuff that supposedly is pure blue mountain coffee i repackage the coffee into one pound bags and grind the beans fresh daily for coffee house quality coffee for only pennies we buy again and again ,1

i have a german shepherd when she was about months we found these at costco she was fully addicted i bought bag after bag i must have bought them out beacuse i havent see them at costco for about a year now which is a bummer but having them on amazon is great they are soft enough to break in half if you want a smaller treat and hard enough to clean the teeth highly recommended ,1
this is an excellent alternative to rawhide and they help to clean your dog is teeth also ,1
what can i say i love iced tea i drink a lot of it and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets i am also a big fan of stash products or rather of all the other stash products i have tried i purchased a case of all varieties when i say i drink iced tea i am not kidding and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my ounces water bottle i finally found that i needed to dissolve packets in a small bit of hot water first if not the tea clumped on me and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable unfortunately by doing that to this flavor the ginger was out of control and not in a good ginger tea sort of way over all i am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market ,0
the package is very nice for gift giving larger than i expected however the system would not allow their promo code offered on to go through so i did not get discount offer on two ,1
i tried this coffee a few years ago and absolutely loved it my market did not have it last month so i ordered it from amazon great coffee at a great price ,1
the package does not lie these are big bars they are also very dense and as a result are very filling they are very chewy so if you have got jaw problems you might wanna skip these that is the only thing i did not like about them that being said they have a great peanut flavor and i enjoyed the layer of peanut butter on the bottom i think the peanut butter makes the bar overall a very tasty snack and a nice large bar ,1
not worth buying tastes like alcohol no chocolate taste at all smells faintly of chocolate but not worth using i wanted to increase the chocolate flavor of my protein shakes without adding carbs this purchase was useless ,0

i love this coffee and was disappointed when they discontinued it for the tassimo brewers i have since bought a keurig brewer and was pleased to see the verona k cups in costco yesterday for about for this same unit quantity the price here is absurd at this time i will wait until i see it on amazon in the dollar range before ordering on amazon ,1
the product is great and hard to find my dogs love themthe service is great the dilivery is very quick,1
this decaf green like every other brand i have tried so far is not green in color and is missing that light fresh green flavor of a good caffeinated japanese style tea i would say it is actually a bit smoky sort of like a chinese style green tea which is not what i am looking for i like smoky green teas like hojicha but i do not like that flavor in plain green tea i have drunk green tea my whole life and tried many kinds from restaurants groceries and asian markets and this one just does not do it for me it was surprising given the glowing reviews at amazon that influenced my decision to buy it so far stash is decaf has been the best but i will keep searching for better ,0
the pate is ok the smoked oysters were dry and tasteless and the salmon was full of bones and it is overpriced to boot ,0
mccann is irish oatmeal is quite different than traditional rolled oats in both texture and flavor note that it takes a half hour to cook so it is not a good choice for workdays i prefer normal rolled oats but this is a nice change occasionally it is very dense similar to al dente pasta in texture it is the equivalent of grape nuts for oatmeal on a per pound basis it is more expensive than rolled oats cracker barrel is oatmeal is similar to mccann is recommend you try it there before purchasing ,1
i know these are supposed to be good for you but they are a little hard to get down without lots of liquid also way too expensive i do not think i will be buying them again ,0
aloha island coffee company bonzai pipeline dark roast is a very mediocre insipid coffee rather acidic for a dark roast the beans are of unknown origin but if there are any kona beans in this anonymous mix they must be the ones other roasters threw out as it does not even vaguely taste like kona actually aloha island coffee co is not even in hawaii it is located in santa ana ca an area not exactly known for great coffee the coffee is extremely overpriced for the poor quality you get which is why i gave it one star and you would be better off buying some of the better brands commonly sold in supermarkets at about one third the price i ordered the oz bags but i could not even make it through the first one and have thrown the second in the garbage i would never buy anything from aloha island coffee company again ,0
chef boy ardee has changed its spagetti sauce formular and not for the better will not buy again ,0
i bought a few containers of this brand a few months ago because they were on clearance apparently because maxwell house changed the look of the product and i loved them i had not tried the peppermint mocha though and i love this too i like the plastic container better than the metal one they had before and the design is more appealing i am not a morning straight up coffee person i like my caffeine kick as much as the next person but i prefer it to be in the form of a mocha or some other equally expensive coffee based drink this product does the job for me it does not have much of a coffee taste at all so if that is what you are looking for you might not enjoy this also as with most mixes and mochas this is full of sugar in fact it is the first ingredient according to the nutrition facts this product has calories of fat of sodium of carbs of sugar and of protein per serving a serving is of mix to of water somehow this mix foams up when mixed in which makes it seem more like a mocha latte than the usual mix i like the taste a lot i just wish it was not so expensive ,1
i have a dolce guso coffee maker and i love it unfortunately in our area the most we can buy are flavored coffees thank you for handling the coffee is for my machine our favorite is lungo and espresso we have several cups a day ,1
best flavor of all the decaf is on here my hat is off to green mountain ,1
these cookies are small hard and very crunchy nice ginger flavor with pleasant afterburn in the back of the throat i like the texture but i am not too fond of the small bits of candied ginger that are mixed into the cookies they have a toffe like consistency and they tend to get stuck in my teeth other than that these cookies are good and it always feels nice to enjoy a snack made with natural ingredients the only way these could be better is if i made them myself without ginger chunks in em ,1
exact same as the ones bought at the store only a lot cheaper recommended for any keurig drinkers out there ,1
great flavor much stronger flavor than an extract only need a drop or two to flavor an entire cup of coffee but i had no idea how little a dram is it is less than a teaspoon i am ordering it again in a larger quantity i use a drop or two in coffee yum yum and no natural or artifical sweetener to worry about ,1
i first came upon applesauce in a pouch when i was in france for a few months i was sooooo happy to find it here with the same brand in the states these pouches make it extremely easy to get a fruit serving no matter where you are it is great for kids because unless they sit on it with the lid off which is bound to happen with kids sometimes there is literally no mess no spoon to carry around no frustration of opening a cup of applesauce only to realize you left your spoon at home no anger from finding out your other fruit got squished in your bag i also love that the applesauce is just apples no added sugar etc so we know it is healthy i recommend this product to anyone with kids or anyone with a busy lifestyle ,1
amazon purchase was great price innova was recommended by our vet and i was happy to find amazon carried the brand very pleased ,1

i expected a very strong taste from this honey and it did not disappoint i actually love the taste and the texture a lot plus i had a chance to test the healing properties when a particularly nasty papercut had continued to bother me for a couple of weeks a couple of applications of this honey took care of it in two days the cut healed beautifully the reason i am giving it four stars and not five is because of the way it is packed the jar could actually be seen between the folds of the cardboard it was delivered in ,1
my dog went for it from the start i was using the same brand but a lower quality food and my dog still likes both but i am switching to the instinct line for quality,1

i drink a lot of tea with honey i snip the tips of the honey stix which is really a straw filled with honey then insert into the cup and stir this provides the perfect amount without adding a spoon or making a mess of sticky honey also good for keeping in my purse for low blood sugar problems the honey does not go bad if it left in my purse for weeks or months does not crush and takes up little room the taste is wonderful very smooth and sweet i keep a pull up dispenser of these like the ones that hold regular straws but smaller on my counter all the time why did not anyone think of this sooner ,1
i am slowly baking my way through i went to all the major chain stores in my town and then the foreign markets and trendy healthy markets the only store that had even heard of spelt flour was the last healthy market and they said that they just recently discontinued spelt so on a whim i searched for it on amazon the price here on amazon is cheaper than any of the other arrowhead flours that i have bought at the local markets plus free prime shipping so not only did i find a good source for spelt i am going to start buying the rest of my specialty flours from amazon like rye and semolina as for the product itself it is a commodity there is not much to say about it i have always been happy with the quality of arrowhead mills products though and this one is no different ,1
ever since i started marathon running i have been searching for a calorie supplement ive tried the gels goos and cubes but was never satisfied the cubes are too big and its hard to breath while chewing them the goos and gels are just too dessicating its like putting peanut butter in my mouth and i need to get something to drink to wash it down the jelly beans are the best yet they are smaller making it easier to breath while running they do not dry your mouth and they also taste good aways a plus they provide cals per pouch and contain no caffeine that said it is not the perfect product the package can be difficult to open while running and occasionally a few beans drop out as you are trying to negotiate them out of the bag and into your mouth also they should make a variety pack packs is enough to last me a month and i prefer to buy only one at a time the same flavor while good can get a little boring they have other flavors a variety pack should not be too hard to make enjoy your exercise ,1
steak chicken or pork really i will go with the steak seeing as how it is steak sauce by the way if someone has too many steaks feel free to send them to me mine disappeared in the great kitty munch a thon never knew cats could eat so much beef she will be lucky to get some canned food while daddy cries about all the meat she ate veggies also welcomed prefferably green but i am not picky any and all is surely appreciated ok steak is higher than veggies goes without saying right i did mention the beef preference right ,1
my puppy goes bonkers for these treats as soon as she sees or hears one of us pick up the bag she comes running as fast as her little feet will move her she literally leaps into the air trying to get to the bag in fact i am on my way to the pet store in just a few minutes to pick her up another bag of them my only suggestion is not to buy them here they are almost half the price at my local pet store than they are at the price on amazon ,1
i just do not care for some of the fruit flavors in this kids seem to like them however ,0
this product is exactly what i wanted pumpkin is not found very easliy and it was great to find and buy what i needed ,1

my wife and family who are gluten sensitive love the product as well as the rest of us jdt,1
you can purchase this product at most any grocery store or yallmart for each which equates to for this package the box weighs next to nothing so shipping is not the difference should be a toss up without the storefront costs so someone is making a great deal of profit from noodles check the other soup packages with nothing but noodles and soup base and you will find a similar trend seems common food items are still the domain of brick mortar stores ,0
excellent works like any other in the category no crash or jitters just a consistent non overpowering boost of energy in the future i will not purchase from amazon there is significant markup on the item to compare i recently bought sugarfree monster at what turned out to be markup from the pricing at a local big box store unit price of apposed to amazon is,1
by the end of a breakfast with fiber one and some fruit you could have already met of your fiber needs for the day fiber one by itself provides it is grams of fiber per serving is more than kellogg is all bran unlike some high fiber cereals this one the original fiber one contains no sugar but derives its sweetness from aspertame as far as i am concerned it is the tastiest high fiber cereal on the market ,1
some sediment will fall through the bottom but i found that this usually occurs when you first put the tea in the yo yo solution hold the yo yo over your tea container tin while while loading it then give it a little shake so that it settles and anything that will fall out falls back into your possession for later use once it is all in there very little falls out then when you add the water the tea swells up a bit making it very difficult to get through the small holes the cup is larger than i am used to but it is a welcomed change i am not sure what size big gulp cups the below reviewer is using for his or her tea but this one is certainly adequate also i really like watching the tea brew through the clear glass it comes with a cover that also acts as a base that you can set the yo yo on this will eliminate any mess made by dripping cleaning the yo yo for me involves turning it upside down and give it a couple soft taps against the included cover base the tea usually just falls right out on command a quick rinse in the sink and it looks brand new again and oh by the way it makes a great cup of tea ,1
great candy pipes and the price was right good purchase deal these are very hard to find so was very pleased tolocated these on amazon ,1
i am disappointed by this product for which i saw raving reviews and so decided to pay its high price i find the resulting mashed potatoes thick lumpy and grainy regardless of how i try to modify the texture a package of much cheaper flakes from the local supermarket can actually be better ,0
believe that it is not right to sell a package of boxes of mcvitie is digestive biscuits less than a month before they were scheduled to expire on april if i had known you were going to do that i would not have bought them please do inform your customers the expiration date when you advertisement on your website ,0
i found the gum to be very good and knowing that it did not have aspertame in it was great the flavor could have lasted a bit longer than it did and i was hoping it would be a little mintier tasting but considering that there is no other gum that is sugar free and does not have aspertame in it that i know of i would buy this gum i also think that the price is too high so i will wait till it goes down before i start chewing it regularly ,1
i recently purchased these based on the reviews posted they arrived quick but when they got here they were extremely stale and filled with hard bits i contacted the seller but they have not responded i am not impressed ,0
this is an adequate decaf k cup while it lacks any significant defects it also lacks much body or richness the main downside is a slight sour aftertaste i will certainly drink what i have but will not be ordering it again better decaf k cups can be found such as donut house or timothy is columbian decaf ,0

chocolate freaks agree that callebaut is amongst the best of the best chocolates these are fabulous in homemade chocolate chip ice cream or melted into any chocolate recipe they used to make straight bars for eating but for some reason they are not oriented to the consumer market any longer a shame ,1

i recently discovered the kashi golean protein bars and as far as protein bars go they are the best tasting imo i especially like the oatmeal raisin one as it reminds me of the oatmeal raisin cookies i had as a kid witht the frosting on the bottom of course these are a bit healthier for you than the cookies and maybe they do not taste quite as good but would you really expect a protein bar to taste like a cookie ,1

in a world toxic from factory farming unnatural additives feed mad cow anyone making sick cows rbgh and pus in the milk i avoid any dairy not from grass fed cows if you shop organic you know how expensive this is for animal products so far as i know goat dairy is free from these evils i tried goat products after reading a couple books on natural diet and healing by dr jordan rubin the maker is diet is good but the protocols repetitive and he is of course promoting his products he designed to recover from crohn is coconut oil and goat milk were important for reasons you need to read yourself anyhow it helped me improve my health too i find i have less congestion allergies and sinus problems the goaty flavor can be overcome by a gradual switchover mixing some goat milk into whatever milk you use be it cow is soy rice after a while you will not notice it much then you may like it i bet after a month or two of no cow is milk you will taste cowy flavor in it our tastebuds change i like both the evaporated and powdered milks my cats do too and it has been okay for feeding a sick cat who could not manage solid food i am going to make some cultured goat milk products since yogurt is over a plastic cup in ohio maybe cheese will be next goat farmers cheese mmm ,1
water is water right i thought so until i tasted essentia water is water but this has a clearer cleaning more refreshing taste for those who exercise and worry about replacing electrolytes this water has been infused with them what better way to replace electrolytes and get your glasses of water a day at the same time and if you drink the whole bottle which is fluid ounces you have had six glasses towards that goal ,1

i love my sodastream and primarily use it to create sparkly water or flavored water with the unsweetened all natural essences but sometimes a girl wants a bit more flavor enter root beer natural to start it is made from cane sugar which i prefer to corn syrup or splenda and it does not have any additional artificial flavors colors or sweeteners as previously mentioned the root beer taste is not knock you over intense but with the sodastream i can adjust it to the exact water flavor mix i want if you are looking for a very strong root beer taste i would recommend virgil or boylan they are sold in bottles and are both very strong second each bottle will make liters approximately servings of all natural soda at this is far cheaper than the other natural sodas you find at the store blue sky thomas kemper hansen etc i prefer this natural root beer to the other soda flavors i have tried from sodastream and will buy it again ,1
i was after that overpriced stadium nachos taste and nothing i could find in stores was the right kind of cheese sauce this stuff is it granted i wanted plain cheese and this actually has a slight jalapeno flavor but that is okay it is still really good the pouches it comes in are a little annoying and i am docking a star for that if they were at least resealable it would help tremendously unless you are using all of it at once the pouches make storage a little awkward otherwise perfect ,1
the dogs love this and with auto delivery i do not have to cart it from the store which any shopper is a pain i never run out this way ,1
i first found this sugar while working at larry is market in seattle the india tree company is also located in seattle it was one of the greatest food discoveries i would forgotten about well not quite i just had no idea why the sugar we ate in africa was so rich and similar to molasses in color this sugar is milled on the island of mauritius off the coast of africa and has the divine flavor only possible from cane growing on volcanic ash here in america most of the brown sugar seems like white sugar coated in a brown coloring in comparison to this rich dark and almost seductive slightly salty tasting sugar when i found this sugar it brought back tons of childhood memories mostly memories of eating a spoonful of sugar as a treat this sugar is that good muscovado is slightly moist has a very high molasses content and is delicious in gingerbread coffee cakes chocolate cakes and anything with chocolate in it you can basically use this sugar in any recipe that calls for dark brown sugar when making cookies you will notice some of the lumps do not quite work themselves into the dough this is no problem because then you just find a few sugar lumps in your cookies if you prefer your sugar to be perfectly soft you can add a piece of apple or bread to your sugar jar until the sugar softens this is one of my top ten ingredient finds of the century the rebecca review,1
i was looking forward to this product as my wife and i both like earl grey tea and decaf lets us drink it at night we drink a variety of tea so we do not go through individual tea very quickly so i was looking forward to the resealable packets unfortunately this tea just does not taste good initially and has a particularly unpleasant aftertaste i definitely would not recommend buying this tea ,0
another popular seafood flavor that sophie and samson will not share when i bend down to place their bowls in front of them they are on their back legs trying to get to it before i can put the bowl on the floor they act like they have not been fed in days nothing will disturb them not even their favorite ups man who brings them treats ca not beat amazon prices ,1
this was the worst tasting tea actually the worst tasting anything that i have ever consumed i took one sip and could not bring myself to finish the cup it tasted like dirt which makes sense since it is a root the rest of the tea bags are going in the trash ,0
product was as promised i found that it lessened the cramping i was getting i also actually enjoyed the taste ,1
i am a big fan of the jaipur chai tea premix and we have a chai drinker group in our office jaipur chai premix is the most convenient way to enjoy flavor of the real indian chai in office we do not have to drink corn syrup loaded coffee from office bistro any more this is simply the best cardamom elaichi chai and i am sold my favorite remains cardamom and masala i am eager to try ginger which shall arrive today i wish they also sale these in larger economy packs the smaller pack is perfect for gifting but may incur too much cost in shipping and why is this not a s s item on amazon ,1
i am a backpacker and when i go on backpacking trips this is a great product for me to bring along ,1
so my favorite sardine supplier stopped for a while and i decided to try some other brands and configurations these are among the most expensive but they were a pleasant surprise i understand why so many sardine eaters just get these little ones there was eighteen of the little fish in the can i just ate i suppose the best i can do to describe the taste comparison with the big ones i am more accustomed to is that the big ones have a sort of tuna ish taste whereas these tend to taste a bit more like clams or oysters the smell is fishy as ever but the taste is more mild quite nice actually ,1
i ordered the wild hibiscus flowers in syrup to give to a friend as an engagement present the shipping was so much that i figured if i wanted to try them too i aught to get one for me as well they came well packaged and in a very timely manner i tried them and they were good tasting and had a good texture it did not seem like the flower bloomed very much in the champagne however but it still looked beautiful in the flute and was fun to look at i would recommend these as well as probably purchase them again at some point i just wish the shipping did not cost more than the item itself ,1
i am a college student and decided to get one of these for my cousin is confirmation a little different kind of a gift that had some pun to it i received both plants promptly earlier than the expected delivery date repotted them and a month later they have grown like little weeds and are doing great love these plants ,1
so helpful so kind such great customer service and their product was gorgeous a small business on which in an ideal world all other businesses would model themselves ,1

my kids love jelly bellies i got these for their easter baskets the boxes are teeny weenie and have a ridiculously small number of jelly beans in them not even half full if you know the size of the conversation hearts boxes you see around valentines day the boxes are almost half the size of those my kids liked them anyway ,0
hands down the best meal replacement available period best taste not a watery consistency and most filling nutritionally whole a regular staple for those times i do not have it to cook a real breakfast ,1
this is probably one of the better coffee substitutes i have tried i am still using a bit of espresso with mine i make lattes with hemp milk scoop teeccino and half a scoop espresso slowly weaning off the espresso i am weaning off the caffeine but will soon be on a diet where i can not have any fruit for a while this is the only down side to this product that and it has barley which is not tolerable by those who are gluten sensitive taste wise though i like it and i really like that you can brew it however you desire and that it is not just another instant powder ,1
very happy with the happy hips made in usa glucosamine addedthe dogs are very happy and i am thrilled with the price after coupon we are trying the duck flavor next ,1
not all new mexico red chile is the same we real new mexicans know that you would want hatch chile for the best enchiladas luna county chile for a pot of chile con frijoles and real nutty sweet chimayo chile for the best carne adovada on earth who knows that this stuff is it is a passable generic but if it was the good stuff corona real would at least know that it is illegal to spell chile as chili here in new mexico sure this stuff makes an ok recipe or molido sauce but for a true cognoscenti it does not cut it ,0
you have to get your timing exactly right to make these taste llike regular pasta play around with the suggested eleven minutes that being said i like them i would not eat them all the time but these are a great gluten free substitute when you get the pasta itch ,1
these flavorice stick ice pops have been a favorite since my youth and are still around today though very hard to find in local supermarkets unfortunately i think most stores do not stock them because they want you to purchase the costlier popsicles and ice creams that only last a short while instead of these long lasting cooling refreshing low priced skinny pops that you freeze as needed and are always a satisfying low calorie treat it is nice to see them available on amazon as in new york the only supermarket i can still find them in is pathmark and they run out fast kids love these too ,1
our two cats are strange one loves the gravy so much she goes to the other cats dish to clean it right up while the bigger cat eats her own fish plus the other cats fish they also dine on seafood sensations dry food during the day we used to buy this item at our local safeway store it went from cents a can to almost a dollar now buying it with the subscription every other month we are down to just cents a can with free delivery ,1

i used to purchase liquor filled chocolate bottles for x mas for quite a few years they were excellent and hoped to get them this year the product web site was being upgraded so i had to isettle for these what a nice surprise to find that they truly were not isecond best these bottles were much larger than the ones i used to get hence more liquor filling i am not that familiar with all the true tastes of the different ispirits but i felt they were all very good i would recommend these to anyone ,1
my mother and i have been a fan of the pomegranate flavot of tea but could never find just this flavor it usually is mixed in with mint tea orange tea etc going to the bigelow website i found boxes of just pomegranate tea but for a price that was a good deal greater than what amazon com sells the order process here was painless and the product just what we wanted ,1
i hate to admit when i am wrong but i was wrong i received a box of these in a coffee raffle basket and i immediately stuck them in the back of the pantry with no intent on using them i prejudged it because i hate instant coffee starbucks coffee is good but i prefer to support local coffee houses whenever possible rather than the mcdonaldization of coffee that starbucks is after so i am one of those superficial friends do not let friends drink starbucks pseudo snobs nothing against the product quality just against the idea and presenation i still say small medium or large whenever i go there sometimes they are the only game in town ca not bring myself to use the startalk names today i tried one because i was too tired to grind and drip surprisingly this stuff tastes pretty good for instant coffee naturally not as good as fresh ground but still pretty good after reading up on it i suppose the difference is between the microgrind and the traditional freeze drying so yes i would drink this coffee again but at the price i am not likely to buy it often or ever trader joe is has a similar type of instant coffee for much less maybe for camping trips but i will try others before buying the starbucks brand five stars for the product quality as far as instant coffee goes lose a star because of the high price which is probably due to the brand than anything else good product overall ,1
if it were not for the price i would give em stars i now buy these at trader joes for a fraction of the price and just as good if not better ,1
i was hesitant at buying these shiitake mushrooms at first knowing that they were from china i reasoned with myself that since they were organic that they had to be okay when i fry them in oil or butter there is such a horrible chemical smell like ammonium that it is unbearable to eat no matter how you try and disguise the flavor the mushrooms taste like they were preserved in ammonium when i put them in a soup base that same horrid chemical aroma is still there ,0
it is creamy like natural peanut butter but the taste is weird very sweet it is not a very good peanut butter substitute the best way i have found to eat it is as a dessert topping i spread some of this on a kim is magic pop topped with cool whip and was a good low cal snack ,0
we are on vacation in maui and i happened to pick up a bag danielle is coconut chips from a shave ice vendor down the street i love coconut but get discouraged by all the over sugared options these are wonderful i have twin boys and i could not get them to stop eating them i was so eager to get my hands on more that i emailed our local whole foods from the beach only to find out that they do not carry the coconut flavor i begged them to reconsider but then i discovered that amazon carries them so all my troubles are over really if you like coconut give these a try by the way the mango is delicious too ,1
this product is great for replenishing your muscles after a tough work out i have also used cytomax during the course of playing pick up basketball and it really keeps me going normally when i just drink water or gatorade during a hard workout i would be sore the next day now that i am using cytomax i am no longer sore and it seems i can work out longer and harder i know this sounds like a commercial but this stuff really works and it taste pretty good plus you can not be the price ,1
it is a quick snack to take away the hunger and easy to share with everyone ,1
i have been eating this for years it is just a good way to start the day pour on some almond milk and enjoy similar to grape nuts but better tasting and better for you not to mention very high priced in retail grocers so nice to get the amazon case price ,1
we love the pouch size and the price but this baby food is sour although the banana and pumpkin should be sweet components the color of the puree is a light yellow and not orange as it appears on the box there is no pumpkin taste lemon juice concentrate and citric acid have been added therefore the predominant taste is sour banana ingredients organic banana organic pumpkin organic lemon juice from concentrate citric acid the composition list is different than on the company is website ,0

this is one of the best spices i have ever used great an everything i found it originally at whole foods and then used amazon ,1
i just paid is for the product and shipping for a serving bag of chips even if this is the healthiest snack on the face of the earth i would still only give star what a ripoff ,0
i was extremely disappointed that his product has liquor in it it should have been mentioned in it description screw this ,0
these mushrooms are great i add them to a sauce if it is a little runny and it soaks up the extra juice without making the sauce simmer these are great in any italian dishes they are a little expensive compared to buying fresh mushrooms but the ease and quickness of adding these to any recipe is great ,1
i love these prunes because they are always fresh and easy to take with me my year old daughter eats them too after i cut them into smaller pieces i just wish amazon is price was better i can not justify buying them here when i can get them for each at my local grocery store amazon is price should be for this case of,1

i am a tea drinker and this bigelow green tea is of my favorites this green tea is mild and has a very light color and a smooth taste i try to stay away from too much sugar so i sweeten mine with a few drops of stevia sweetener i especially go to this tea when i am sick it is great hot and soothes sore throat even better than chicken soup tea comes in sealed packets last time i ordered this pack was at least a year ago i just finished my last box and this one was as good as my first if you like black tea try darjeeling from bigelow it is my favorite black tea ,1
i am a huge organic products enthusiast and i am a fan of amy is products i bought this soup in hopes of it having some sort of pizzaz i was sorely disappointed after having heated it up i tasted it and was shocked with how bland it was it was a meek soup almost as if they created a black bean base tossed some veggies in and left it at that uh where are the spices the herbs the excitement only after adding some hot sauce salt pepper garlic cumin and sour cream did the soup become worthy to be eaten with the rest of my lunch if you are a fan of more mild soups this could be for you if you are just a fan of plain veggie soups this certainly could be for you but if you like a little jazz in your soup do not buy this unless you are ready to dump a jar of salsa in ,0
the best gluten free cornbread mix by far just add eggs oil or butter and water it is not dry like other gluten free mixes i have tried we almost always use the cheese cornbread recipe on the bag i really like the low fat version then i do not feel so guilty adding the cheese ,1
i love this cake mix but can not find it in any of my local stores i am so glad for this opportunity to purchase it online i think it is the best angel food cake mix on the market ,1
i have a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past i wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health this time i steeped it in boiling water added lots of honey and poured it over ice it is still not the best tasting tea variety but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others as far as it is potency effectiveness i suppose i will not know until the baby comes although realistically i am not sure i will even know then this price is amazing too i kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store i will definitely be buying my next box here instead ,1
this product defines a little goes a long way just as a quality concentrated tomato paste should this is the real deal and has great taste ever so much better than canned tomato paste waste less and use less refrigerate after opening and it will last a long time unfortunately many americans have no idea how to use this product and think it is just expensive tomato paste not short of taking a trip to italy you can not find better buy it use it and i am confident you will agree ,1
i do not usually write reviews but was compelled to advise everyone i have purchased two different flavors the first box arrived about a day after the coffee got released there were about k cups that were damaged and coffee grounds were everywhere to amazon is credit they issued a refund the second box was delivered with no damage to the k cups so i have brewed about of the k cups and around of them are faulty i never have had this issue with other brands either i get a ton of coffee grounds in my coffee or end the end of the brew cycle when the machine blows air out it splatters coffee grounds all over my coffee cup coffee maker or counter i then have to discard that cup and brew another such a waste i do think the coffee is great and flavorful i would purchase again if they would fix the issues with the k cups until then i can not recommend anyone purchase this product ,0
fed my great dane rottweiler mix dog this food for year during that time she would eat grass all the time fart a lot be hungry all the time beg a lot poop a lot and have diahorrea occasionally my dog is a very high energy dog that plays fetch everyday for an hour and a walk for an hour she started urinating in the house involuntarily and i took her to the vet vet said the protein levels are too high in the blood kidneys are under a lot of pressure and asked me to stop feeding this food my rationale if protein in this food is not for a high energy and athletic dog like mine then what kind of a dog is this suitable for although the ingredients are good protein levels are too high for any dog and most of it is not digestible so this food is not good reviews from people who fed their dogs this food for more than months have not been good so please use the brain cells you got and analyse and stay away from this food ,0
i got this fondant for my brother is wedding i will not be using it until this weekend so the only things i can comment on right now are the taste and the color and texture first off right out of the bucket this fondant was very stretchy and easy to work with i pulled out a chunk just to see out it worked before i ordered more i found it very nice and i am just beginning to work with fondant i was very concerned with the fact that it was being delivered on a degree day but it stayed gummy and workable and did not melt or stick to anything the color was gorgeous i was a little worried about it leaving a blue or green color residue or not quite being black but it is a great color and did not bleed everywhere lastly the taste i tried it and i have to say this is some of the best tasting fondant i liked it so much that i ordered the white and i plan on making the flowers out of it because i know people will love them update worked very well i made many flowers and other decorations for the cake with this everyone thought it tasted great and looked wonderful my only complaint is that it did not dry as hard as other products i have used so i had to be very careful when moving them around as they easily lost shape or fell apart i am not sure if this was because of the fondant or because of the heat even though i made sure they were in a cool dry place my other issues is that no matter what i tried it was very sticky and stuck to the mat that i was rolling it out on once i let it sit out for or so it got much easier to work with and i was able to actually roll and cut ribbons without them breaking or sticking overall i would buy this again just takes a little bit of getting used to ,1
i really like the taste of these bars they are not overly sweet they taste good and they make a satisfying snack the biggest drawback is that they are not actually crunchy they are actually pretty sticky and gooey so not something to toss to the kids in the car unless you have some wet wipes handy as far as snack alternatives go pure natural bars are certainly better than chips or cookies if your kids will eat them mind did not care for them however i liked these for a quick breakfast or snack for myself ,1
tastes like real coconut water and is not as sweet as the others healthy drink for kids and my year old loves it ,1
this is pretty good i like the taste a lot however it does not behave in your mouth like normal hard candy instead it develops into sharp edges as you suck on it enough to cut your tongue also i am gassier when i eat these than with other similar products dr john is xylotol sweetened hard candy does not have these problems i hope xyla sorts out these issues ,0
i have feeding my cat this since she was a kitten she has a very nice coat and no health issues so far i normally bought this from petco but i saw it on amazon for and thought it was a great deal the price now is much more inline with petco so i do not know if i would order from here again ,1
all i can say is wow i read the other reviews for this product here on amazon i thought that surely it could not be as good as everyone was saying i mean come on it is only salsa i am here to tell you this stuff is the best salsa i have ever had i eat salsa just about everyday i would love it if it was a little more chunky but the flavor just can not be beat the medium has a little bit of a kick to it but not as much as i would have expected i added a few tablespoons of texas pete hot sauce to about a cup of this stuff and that kicked it up a few notches my wife asked why i bought this from amazon when it is available at costco then she realized she has not seen it there in a while i will be checking soon to see if our costco has it i think bucks a jar is a little too much to pay for it at amazon and that is why i gave it stars instead of it though you are in for a treat ,1
ca not go wrong here intense flavor and impressive ingredients i love em and everyone i give them to loves them get a load of these ingredients organic evaporated cane juice organic tapioca syrup no sulfites added non gmo citric acid from non gmo sugar beet organic natural flavors watermelon pomegranate orange oils lemon oils raspberry organic natural colors red cabbage purple carrots cheeky lemon wet face watermelon pomegranate pucker orange squeeze upcoming mango tango flavor contain some amount of orange or lemon or citrus oils of the natural flavor formula of watermelon is derived from lemon oil safflower oil is in the wet face watermelon and upcoming mango tango holy cow and they re really really good ,1

i bought these shortly after having bought the larger sproutmaster tray as i mostly only sprout for myself the smaller trays made a lot more sense i try to stagger my sprouts now so i always have fresh sprouts on hand these are incredibly easy to use and clean although i recommend having some sort of brush for cleaning smaller seeds sprouts tend to get stuck in the holes i highly doubt the expensive automatic sprouting trays could be any easier to use than these i spend maybe mins rinsing my sprouts a day and thats it ,1
first i want to say that we absolutely love this product we found this in germany and fell in love with it so we were pleasantly surprised to find it on amazon however we ordered it and it never came i also found that this product is definitely over priced we ended up cancelling our order because it never came according to the time that was promised i was actually very patient and waited for a good weeks and it still did not come i tried to contact the seller through amazon but never even got a response so after cancelling i found a nearby german deli and it was less than do not waste your time in ordering this ,0
i was hoping to receive this in time for making a german christmas dinner for my family since it was coming from germany i thought i cut it too close i was happily surprised to receive the item in nine days from ordering very pleased with the service ,1

our local market used to carry this product but then they closed i was sooooo happy to see it on amazon i use it every morning when i brew my coffee i use coffee and teeccino this cuts down on the acidity of the coffee now i can drink as much coffee as i like and not worry about my stomach getting upset i have tried all the flavors and this one is my favorite ,1
i studied the keurig machines and others for over months before deciding on this one my main fear on the keurig was the unbelievable amount of bad reviews for the water pumps failing their home systems especially the platinum seem to be plagued with this issue yet this unit and most of the other commercial units appear immune the downside to going with the commercial unit is they are not compatible with the my k cup do not despair there is a solution my experience i purchased a from the local staples for i unwrapped my new beauty and filled it full of water per the instructions my heart sank as the just out of the box unit would not prime i figured i must be doing something wrong and called keurig they confirmed the unit was defective right out of the box not happy but i thought i would give it one more go i took it back to staples who happily exchanged the item this time success the unit works great and i have had no other issues in the month of ownership use of filtered or bottled water highly recommended to extend the unit service life unit has a year warranty from keurig so i am very happy with my purchase so far those who complained about the noise surprised me a bit it does hum and buzz a bit i admit but it lasts what maybe seconds while it fills with water really seemed a bit silly to me now the big win here i was willing to trade the inability to use the my k cup for a reliable unit but found the ekobrew reusable filter for keurig here on amazon it works great with the and i recommend it if you want to use your own blend of coffee for what it is worth that is my cents ,1
this product is great for taste stretching out a meal for a tight budget economy and easy for a lazy cook ,1
the sprouter is working fine my seeds are sprouting marianna settles,1

i got this for my lbs german shepherd mix unfortunately he does not like it but the chihuahua does the big one goes through rawhide quickly so i thought this might slow him down a bit but no luck he gives it a lick once in a while but does not want anything to do with it most of the time the chihuahua loves it but it is way too big for him so he just chews on the corners ,1
this is really a good product made by genesis and it helps me to reduce weight i am giving this five stars for the fact that it seems to be processed properly it certainly has no added sugars and it came really quickly from the supplier it does not taste like a berry or it is not sweet or yummy ,1
these arrived in a brown bag and had a big assortment of coffee decaf tea iced tea and iced coffee lots of different brands i would never seen rev brooklyn and lots of familiar ones donut house emeril gloria jean nothing was past due and most expire at the end of or in a few were things i am not sure i cared about decaf earl grey tea for example but i am pretty sure someone at the office will drink it great price for them nice variety shipped fast and nothing stale however if you are looking for a more specific variety like just coffee and no decaf or tea you might be disappointed this is the best price and most variety in a k cup package i have ordered ,1
these snails are the best quality i have ever tasted outside of a restaurant and from a can and at a much better price than i have seen them for elsewhere they are a higher price than other canned escargot but their smoothness and flavor are worth it especially if escargot are a special treat for you i have never found grit or parts of shell in them either these do not have to be stuffed into shells i simply put them in a small oven proof bowl after rinsing well and shaking the water off in a colander with chives garlic bits a tiny bit of garlic salt and place pats of butter on top pop them into a degree oven for minutes and they are ready ,1
omg best coffee ever for the keurig i wont even drink anything else except of course flavors on occasion seriously brew this one on travel mug size and mmmmm enjoy ,1

just logged onto amazon searching specifically for ginger people ginger beer since no local stores carry it like the previous reviewers i have tried many different brands of ginger beer and this one is my hands down favorite sharp with a clean strong ginger y taste and tiny ginger particles that settle to the bottom to give the last swallow a little final punch in my household it is the clear winner ,1
it does not work as expected just after served three glasses of wine i noticed the splatter all over the table the wine would also dripped from the two holes on each side of the aerator along the arm holding the aerator all the way down to the bottom of the base i can deal with the wine dripped from the aerator but not the splatter since it will ruin your beautiful table cloth unless you place it on the kitchen counter it would be messy even on the kitchen counter this deluxe package looks elegant when first set up but it looks messy just after served three glasses of wine i will be returning this to amazon for a refund ,0
this product was the perfect combination of moist but still chewy it tasted so good since i absolutely love banana but i hope that quaker comes out with many flavors because these are delicious ,1

i like coconut water and have tried many brands but this one has the worst taste tastes like water with bad tasting electrolyte powder after openning the first can decided to thrash all,0
i loved getting cans and cans of pumpkin goodness in the mail others have noted that their cans were dented from shipping i noticed that about half the cans had small dents but no broken seals if the top of the can was dented i just used my can opener on the bottom so i had no issues extracting and eating lots of pumpkin puree ,1
good transaction product as described timely delivery this was second order of this product and we will do again steve,1

i have been buying virginia peanuts for twenty years mostly from virginia diner and these royal oak peanuts are vastly superior why they are fresh they are so crisp that if all you have ever tasted are grocery store peanuts you would better get ready for a shock to your taste buds that will knock your socks off they say they grow em cook em and ship em and i believe em wow ,1
i like the jelly belly beans they are fat free and made from natural ingredients the flops may be odd shaped but they taste the same as the perfectly shaped jelly bellies if you want more variety you need to order at least two bags they will send you one bag with more variety you never know what flavors you will receive but i enjoy eating any flavor so for the price it is a good deal if you are particular about a certain flavor spend more for the regular bags they are worth it ,1
too messy sifting the litter creates a lot of dust which goes right into my nose also the pan is too low near the entrance resulting in a lot of spilled litter and finally the process of disassembling sifting reassembling takes longer than scooping i will use the pans for something else ,0
wow a little disappointed in the previous review not sure what would make the soup taste cardboard ish just because it was ordered from amazon i too buy mine in local supermarket it is fabulous and has become a weekly sometimes bi weekly dinner staple at my house i am going to order it from here and see what happens if it turns out to be cardboard ish tasting i will downgrade my review ,1

i have a mr coffee tea maker use of these gallon sized tea bags in it and it is perfect makes excellent tea and actually saves me more money than buying generic using bags to get tea strong enough i went on suscribe save w this one i am convinced this is a way better deal than i can get in a store anywhere around here and as we are avid tea drinkers i am loving this ,1
i recently began drinking blue thunder drinks again after a several year hiatus i have found that this is a good pick me up drink during the workout and have been enjoying them as a snack during the day post workout i still enjoy chocolate milk or milk generally which i still maintain is one of the best drinks for building strength and mass but blue thunders certainly have their place and i think they are particularly good when you put them in the freezer for awhile and let them get some ice crystals tastes like a popsicle during these hot days here in the mid atlantic you will not find a better deal than amazon is subscribe and save either these things are too expensive if you try to buy them at a retail store or have to pay shipping on rtd products at most online shops thanks amazon ,1
i have tried many different coconut water brands and flavors this one does not have great flavor compared to other brands i would not recommend this product very bland i should have listened to past reviews ,0
waggin train has been under investigation since for over dogs deaths and illnesses my dog got lucky and lived check out waggin train fb page for more info and the thousands of consumers who have lost their pets due to these toxic treats its not just these it is any treats made in china ,0
i found this to be unnaturally sweet i have tried many different coconut waters both packaged and fresh from the coconut the product lists far more carbs than any other packaged coconut water i have tried given these two things i am thinking it is likely this product is boiled or otherwise condensed this may be good for those weaning off sugary beverages but if you are looking for a coconut water that tastes like fresh from the coconut this is not it ,0
this tea is very hearty definitely double in earl grey bergamot flavor i recommend it to anyone who likes a stronger tea and you can not beat the deal especially with the prime program save a couple of dollars free shipping add a little sweetner and cream and it really enhances the flavors ,1
most bottled salad dressings do not appeal much to me but wish bone spritzers fill a niche in a unique way sometimes especially with garden fresh veggies we do not want the dressing to overpower the amazing flavors of the just picked salad ingredients with these spritzers you can add a light mist of dressing that enhances rather than obscures light on calories and fats too because you use so little mmmmm ,1
bucks for pounds is ridiculous and they are pretty good people are saying there is an aftertaste but i am not getting it not the best but not the worst the red ones flavor is really good and tastes of cherries the blue ones are meh and sort of flat and the white ones are pretty good but i have no idea what it is consistency is good and flavor is really good for the price paid ,1

my dogs had to be on food with limited ingredients for a while and this was the best of the types i tried the dogs ate it easily although without great gusto and it helped us get through the medical issues that precipitated our use of it vet recommended i would not use for day to day dog food since other flavors without limited ingredients appeal to the dogs more ,1
this k cup carousel is the perfect size not too big not too small i own a larger one and a smaller one they just took up too much counter space or did not hold enough varieties of k cups the foot print is small and fits under my cabinets with plenty of room to spare it is well made and the finish is perfect look brand new and it spins easily to get the k cups i have not had any problems with it and am so glad i decided to order it it sits on my kitchen counter,1

my grandmother taught me to use this when i was much younger i have never been without it until the restaurant i purchased it from went out of business i could purchase the oz size from supermarket but was spoiled by the price of larger bottle you can use this on anything from soups what a great enhancer to vegetables and meat it adds a distinct and wonderful flavor to anything you use it on it is definitely not like soy sauce i make a vegetable medley and sprinkle this on to everyone is delight i am so glad i found maggi seasoning here i will be purchasing it again soon i am sure i may purchase a backup bottle to make sure i never run out again as to the expiration i have had bottles for over a year with no change in flavor at all no ill effects either it has a very long shelf life anyone who tries maggi seasoning in a bottle will love it ,1

this is a great pre workout drink i had some issues using other products such as n o explode with upset stomachs which resulted in unproductive workouts this stuff works and is made by the makers of muscle milk does not taste great but it is drinkable the only problem i had was with the mg of caffeine present in every scoop i liked this but they now have a new item out called muscle n o i bought it at costco it is the same company it only has mg of caffeine and has no creatine in it like the fast twitch does another option is the fast twitch lemonade flavor which has no caffeine overall good product ,1
i was really hoping to get a really great nutritious delicious snack for my family when i ordered this product i was really disappointed the packaging is really good looking and i had high hopes so when i opened the package to my chips i expected something great i ordered the chili lime flavor and since i have had higher fat chili lime chips in the past i would knew that i would love them first they do not really look like what they appear to be on the packaging no big deal though i took a bite out of the first chip and it had a really funny texture and strange flavor so i looked on the back where it showed the ingredients and i was pretty surprised it had a lot of chemicals in the product also and this really freaked me out the main ingredient is not a sliced potato but potato ingredients potato flakes potato starch in other words it is made of instant mashed potatoes i thought the taste was funny and the ingredients curious however there are no transfats or saturated fats in the chips that is why i gave it in all i would rather pack my kids lunches with a bag of lay is or kettle chips than give them these chips all the best ,0
a friend turned me onto this tea at work wow it is good i bought the pack at a great price on amazon now my wife and daughter love it too if you like cinnamon try it ,1

i ordered the pack and received two of each flavor and three of one flavor i understand this is a random selection so it is luck of the draw my complaint i visualize a couple of people packing these boxes just tossing the k cups in a box from other random boxes no liner separators or even stacking so when it arrived a couple of the tops were slit open obviously by hitting against the edges of another k cup nothing spilled out so i was able to use them expiration dates were mid thru early i received the order in dec the earliest exp date was five months away would i order it again sure the price is decent many k cup samplers charge over a buck per k cup ,1
i am a repeat buyer of this sweetener it tastes so good and how great to not be adding extra calories to your coffee ,1

i found this dog food after reading the reviews a this earned their top category stars for premium dry food we have a very picky pomeranian and she loves it,1
our baby eats the stuff it is a bit pricey but at least i feel better about it being organic my wife uses warm water in the bottle to ease mixing of the powder i use cold water and shake i have not noticed any difficulties i am no scientist so i have to believe the label it advertises that they are only using organic stuff and nothing bad for the baby it costs more but it allows me to sleep better and believe i have done something good for the child is health that said if money was tight enfamil woudl serve just as well ,1
i tried steel cut oatmeal for the first time this week and i am hooked i will never go back to regular oatmeal again i cook mine overnight in the slow cooker using a variation of alton brown is overnight oatmeal recipe substituting raisins for the figs just because i like them better my slow cooker tends to run hot so i put the temperature to warm overnight and then crank it up to low about an hour before serving just enough time to have coffee and read the morning paper my family devoured it and asked for more pretty good for folks who do not normally even eat breakfast ,1
i ordered these because i was never able to find the flavor in any local store the flavor is great and is not overwhelmingly spicy to the point where your mouth is burning just a nice solid kick of spice and then it is time for another could not be more satisfied ,1
i still like trader joe is sweet potato chips but tj is pale in comparison to glories maybe the bad reviewers got a bad batch i got delicious bags of bite sized chips with a normal amount of oil i add a bit of salt no problem for me i actually signed up for glories auto delivery guess i am addicted ,1
like many people my first exposure to scotch were brands like j b and seagrams in other words instant turn off i recieved a bottle of macallams year old scotch as a gift i tried it and was smitten to understand how good this is you need only sniff a botte of j b and then sniff macallams the aroma and therefore the taste is amazing ,1
ohh boy oberto it is fresh jerky when it comes to your door with amazons awesome delivery service you will not be upset at all we have tried regular pepper and the bbq pork flavor and there all great and rember jerky is a great source of protein,1
we bought this product at a local warehouse store in the count box strictly because of the price we had never seen or heard of them before so were a bit skeptical but had no opinion good or bad i read reviews after the purchase because i liked it so much i came to amazon because i wanted to see if i could order it online and save us a trip and i got a real chuckle out of some of the reviews i am not sure of why the product got such bad reviews from some people yes it is a strong coffee and maybe too strong for some people even our son said it was stout but we first brewed it on the smaller settings now we brew on the largest setting and have had no problems with it also because of the design we put the cups in an airtight container to help keep them fresh so do not store them outside in one of the many k cup holders that are popular in the end i guess it really is true that if you try to please everyone you end up pleasing no one and i am sure there are those in the internet world who could make a career out of complaining but i would recommend the product to anyone with the caviat that it is a bit on the strong side and to be aware that taste is truly subjective but i think overall it is a good product and the price is great ,1
the product is very good however it does not match the product on the image which was what i wanted to buy price and shipping are excellent ,1
i used extra yeast and a little more water and it came out very light with a heard crust which i like i will order it again not much of a potato taste but good bread,1

this is great ginger ale we have searched a long time to find it since retail stores no longer carry this boylan flavor due to a bottling size difference the bottles are packed carefully so they are not damaged in shipping ,1
these granola bars combine the best two ingredients chocolate and peanut butter but they are a little on the hard dry side they would go really well with milk or some sort of hot beverage but on their own they are not as chewy as i would have hoped however they are filling and tasty with the chocolate chips on top satisfying any chocolate craving one might have ,0
one of hubby is favorite recipes is quinoa mango salad but i hate peeling fresh mangoes it took a long time to find the large can after our grocery store dropped them they are more expensive than fresh mangoes but since i cook almost everything from scratch they are a great time saver mangoes are solid and in good shape i add the juice to the water in which i cook the quinoa covers some of the strong quinoa taste they are gf have no msg or related products or aspartates wish they came on the subscription plan you can get free shipping if you have something elso to order to go over,1

i am a cereal lover with a wide range of tastes in cereal i usually enjoy the healthier varieties like raisin bran or frosted mini wheats but i also enjoy the sweeter kinds like capn crunch and lucky charms the kellogg is krave double chocolate is probably as chocolatey as you would expect it to be with that name if you like chocolate and you like cereal this is probably a good match for you i found it to be have more chocolate flavor than counth chocula and with a better texture the only negative for me was that they seemed to get soggy pretty quickly but for some people that is actually a plus ,1
i love this quinoa i have tried several brands and this is definitely the best imho i have prepared it as a savory side dish using things like french onion soup instead of water and i have prepared it as a breakfast cereal using dr oz is recipe which is slightly sweet it is quite versatile and the nutritional benefits are amazing check out to see all of the nutritional value this little wonder has to offer unfortunately it is too expensive on amazon so like others i buy it at costco ,1
ok maybe it is me but when i see that this is a sampler with tons of different flavors listed i assume that i am going to get just that tons of different flavors or atleast give me a similar number of each flavor this order was a joke from the beginning it arrived in a punctured box but perhaps that happened in delivery i open the box and find a paper bag stapled shut i open the paper bag find a bunch of tossed in k cups then when i pull them out i counted that i had like of one flavor and of some and or of others this really is incredibly unorganized i will not buy from this vendor again ,0

i have purchased these freeze dried natural chicken breast treats in the past from a few different suppliers so i know what to expect in terms of product characteristics quality i have a dentally challenged senior cat who is diabetic in remission has a hyperthyroid condition mega colon he has lost several teeth so it was important that i find a treat for him that he likes that not only is natural without additives or sugars but also has a soft tender consistency that is easy for him to chew these real food toppers freeze dried chicken breast pieces were the perfect solution my cat loved them they even print soft to chew right on the packaging i found this listing on amazon with an outstanding discounted price so i decided my next order would be from amazon i also decided to make it an autoship subscription as well so saving even more unfortunately when the shipment arrived i was quite disappointed to find chicken pieces that were dried up hard maybe of the pieces were soft enough to give my cat in fact because when i offer treats to my cat i normally have to break the large chunks into smaller bite sized pieces i found the majority of the product in this order to be so hard i could not even break them apart with my hands if i attempted to cut them up into much smaller pieces with a knife so he could maybe chew those the product simply disintegrated into crumbs all pouches in my order were the same unacceptable quality i also determined that not a single one had a best by date on the packaging since every other package i would ever purchased regardless of who the supplier was always had dates on them i figured these pouches must have been very very old because i opened all pouches thinking i would eventually have to find some acceptable pieces i was unable to return the order when i receive the shipment if there are no dates on any of the pouches then i will be returning the order unopened otherwise i will open a pouch if i find the contents unacceptable i will return the shipment cancel the remainder of the autoship subscription ,0
makes a beautiful vodka gin drink a ounce bottle is good for two of them do not like my booze too diluted at about per small bottle it is rather pricey but it is definitely of connoisseur quality if it was not for super saver free shipping it would be outrageously expensive since the standard shipping charge for bottles is is my guess that the importer is picking up the shipping cost and is doing so to get more people to try their beverages do not know how much longer this will last if i would have to pay the shipping cost i would purchase fever tree locally instead the price would be a lot less than the cost with shipping added attention the price for a pack of this excellent mixer has just gone up here at amazon to from with no super saver option making it just too expensive now if i want some i will buy it locally for per pack plus tax if it goes higher than per pack i am done with it if it returns to its previous with super saver option i will continue to order from amazon otherwise i will just forget about it ,1
of a bundle different plants i bought this time they again arrived absurdly quickly disreguard the days maybe it will ship by thing amazon states the seller got it to me from california to boston in less than days from order to door plants healthy packed nicely and plenty of moss for planting with detailed care sheets for each and every one great prices and great plants thanks ,1

mad dog is revenge was an awesome purchase i make a lot of hot things and just using habaneros it is hard to get the heat the same every time as the intensity of the peppers differ from one to the next not so with mad dog is revenge a couple of drops from the eye dropper is the same every time no guess work once i have a recipe down i can make the same again and again from hot chocolates to strabanerro jam the heat without any flavor change great product hot chocolates drips mad dog is bag of hershey is special dark chips strabanerro jam cups pur ed strawberries drops mad dog is revenge cups sugar package pectin the only negative thing i can say about this product is that it does not come with an eyedropper so some product gets wasted every time if an eyedropper were built into the lid it would be perfect beaser hendrix,1
numi has created a breakfast blend with four of the most popular black teas keemun assam ceylon and darjeeling the aroma is a fine grassy floral tea blend the leading flavor is keemun a malty slightly smoky flavor this is a smooth subtle cup of tea without some of the more characteristic robustness of most breakfast blends however it is still a very stimulating blend fairly high in caffeine i would guess from its effect unfortunately numi does not list caffeine count on the box numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging the boxes containing their tea is made from recycled paperboard from post consumer waste they assert that by using such packaging materials they save trees reduce landfill by and prevent greenhouse emissions numi uses only natural ingredients without added oils or natural flavorings ,1
sunmaid fruit bits are my favorite snack and it seem that our local grocery supplier has dropped this particular sunmaid item i am pleased to be able to buy them on amazon ,1

this thing is huge and my great dane absolutely adores it i purchased chews a knotted one and this braided one and i must say that i am very happy that is saying a lot because i usually hate rawhide my dog normally devours most rawhide treats in about minutes and during that time manages to tear off at least one soft wet chunk big enough to choke on and scare the daylights out of me these are designed in a way those scary moments have not happened these chews are truly chunky the ring is easily over inches diameter and the braid is about inches across the rawhide is super thick and the whole thing is heavy the braided design makes it so he cannot pull large pieces off to choke on and he has to work very hard to get even small pieces off normally if he has to work hard at a chew he will just give up but not these he carries it all over the house plays with it by throwing it in the air which is very loud on my wood floor and then settles down for some chewing time this chew keeps him entertained for a good hour or more in this hour of chewing he does not devour the rawhide like many other brands we have tried he just barely manages to get a small inch section gnawed soft then gets tired and takes a nap in days he has not gotten bored with this routine and we still have of the original chew left to me that is a cost effective chew toy he seems to prefer this braided ring over the knotted type maybe because the circle design enables him to hold the chew firmly with his paws see picture or maybe because of the tasty beef basting even more impressive is that the basting looks to be thoroughly embedded into and throughout all of the rawhide not just brushed on the outside it does not come off on his white legs or my beige carpet how wonderful is that i feel it is important to note that these are all natural rawhide chews made in the usa illinois they do say a product of brazil on the outside of the package because they are made from free range natural grass fed brazilian beef hides without chemicals preservatives or bleaches they are also antibiotic hormone and preservative free all of their rawhide products are lot coded for traceability back to the cow they are a petag product a usa company founded in which is a division of borden another usa company so in closing they might seem a bit expensive at first glance but i have discovered they are high quality long lasting and dog entertaining that to me is worth every penny and if my dog ever makes it through the chews i we already have i will happily purchase more ,1
after trying several different almond butters i can honestly say this is far and above the rest no oily mess to deal with and unbeatable consistency with the individual packages you can take them to go or use them as your serving proportions i have been nothing but pleased with my purchase and the many other different variations justin is has produced so check them all out ,1

after reading about the effect soy products have on the thyroid system i decided to replace my soy milk with coconut milk i have never been a big fan of coconut so i was concerned i would not like it i was really surprised i love it it tastes rich like whole cows milk but with a touch of coconut ,1
this candy was ok but it had a different taste than the one we had previously bought at costco even though it was supposed to be the same flavor but the one in costco said new improved recipe perhaps this one was the old recipe i was disapointed but the quality of the candy was fine just not the same as the one i already had so this candy is not being eaten any nearly as fast this candy was a brighter red color and not as soft however this candy did have a stronger strawberry flavor ,0
my wife and i both enjoy a margarita every once in a while so the crystal light mocktail margarita mix sounded very appealing we are glad we ordered it since you get the refreshing taste of a frozen margarita without the alcohol in addition it is sugar free and low sodium so there are only calories and milligrams of salt in an fluid ounce serving of course you can add tequila to it and make a new version of the real thing to make a simple cocktail mix a packet of crystal light margarita mix according to the directions on the pack is label and set aside rub lime juice on the rim of a margarita glass and dip it into a plate covered with salt to coat the rim of the glass fill the glass with crushed ice and ounce of tequila then fill the rest of the glass with the crystal light margarita drink mix stir and enjoy however be aware that this will increase the number of calories the amount of sodium and you ll need to take all precautionary measures and follow all the laws involved with alcohol consumption ,1
i really wanted to like this especially after reading the reviews but i did not like these at all to be honest they taste a little like dirt i regret spending the money on them ,0
i got one of these for my dog for a christmas present a few years ago it immediately became her favorite toy if there are several toys on the floor she will always go for this first she is a fifty pound golden retriever and border collie mix she does not have a great toy drive but this is ideal for her one of these lasts her about six month ,1
i prepared them like i had them prepared for me when i was at a buddhist monastery cleaned sliced thinly and salted and peppered and they were great at the monastery but these had a funky stronger odor and a slightly moldy flavor though i could not see any mold on the product i have frozen the ones i did not use and will thaw later to see if that helps with the flavor it is not worth returning but i would not recommend them ,0

first time i decided to try this out for kona the price is great of course and the freshly opened bag is fragrant and yet it is one of those you get what you pay for situations except here you get much less than you paid for the brew barely tastes like coffee even with five teaspoons to a small cup it still tastes like boiled cardboard you will buy a better coffee in a supermarket any kind you pick will be better and cost about the same bottom line not recommended i will not i am so pissed i paid for this crap i am trying to get a refund the ground matter itself when dry smells nice but the brew you could brew sawdust with the same exact result no taste no aroma no caffeine kick no matter how much you use per cup black sludgewater horrible and should be against the law to sell it the only use for this junk i can see is to sprinkle it around the house dry cause it smells nice while dry this product is a quintessential ripoff stay sent it back and just got a refund whew so that is that at least i can thank them and amz for the complete lack of hassle with returns ,0

i love this creamer in my coffee however reviewers are correct about the pump and many many reviewers comment on its poor quality i can not imagine why the folks at the company do not get the hint executives what do you have to do to make them come to their senses anyway it will work for a while but soon stops pumping all together it just gets gradually harder and harder to push the pump down until you are leaning all your weight on it just to get the pump to depress i finally sawed through the top with a serrated knife and poured it into an empty water bottle so i can easily unscrew it and use i plan to buy a nice empty soap dispenser to pour the creamer into and use it that way the above reviewers advice to freeze the extra creamer is a good tip that i will use i will just thaw it out when i need to refill the dispenser ,1

these pistachios are the real deal they are large nuts and almost of them are wide open which makes them very easy to shell these nuts taste great and come in a sturdy plastic container with a screw on top which will help keep them fresh during storage there are no artificial ingredients or preservatives in these nuts and as a big added bonus they are grown and packaged in the usa the ingredient list only has two ingredients california pistachios dry roasted and sea salt does not get more natural than that right they are so delicious that the biggest problem i have with them is keeping myself from eating a whole container of them in one sitting ,1
sugar free and so flavorful my nieces l o v e these as much as i do i keep them in the cup holder of my car as well as in my purse i have digestive issues and often experience feedback from mints but not from these i originally purchased them at world market an offshoot of pier but they have stopped carrying them so i now buy a case at a time online hope you will enjoy these as much as my nieces and i do ,1

when it comes to coffee i am somewhat picky but this is one of the better ones i bought on amazon so far while it is a dark roast it does not have the clearly burned taste i had to endure with many of the dark roast whole beans i tested during the last months sometimes it was outright tragic in that i tested a new one and it was really good just for the second batch i ordered to be so burned it was barely drinkable i am using these beans in my jura espresso machine with settings for strong brew they give me a pleasant and complex coffee the only complaint is that is is a little flat in the end but as i said when it comes to coffee i am very picky and these beans are definitely in the top that i have tried so far and amongst those give the best value i ordered pound so far and both were not over roasted which seems to be a good sign too given my previous experiences bottom line can recommend will buy again ,1
i am doing atkins and i really missed noodles for me it was not necessary to have pasta per se but anything close and these ramen like noodles seemed like a good thing to try having also tried low carb pasta i can say these are a huge improvement so far i have only used them in stir fry in which they are perfectly tasteless until they absorb the flavors in which you cook them i was frightened at first that i would be able to taste the strongly fishy smell of the liquid in which they are packaged but by following the instructions rinse them for like seconds and plunk them in some boiling water for a minute i was able to completely de fishify them my main concern now is the cost since these cost about what a similarly sized pack of ramen noodles costs i am hoping to be able to get them in larger quantities hopefully more densely packed in the package since it seems like of the package weight just goes down the drain if i can get these for less than a dollar per oz serving by buying in enormous quantities i will eat them twice a day for the rest of my life seems like they could sell these in larger packages or jars and get a higher noodle to water ratio i bet the biggest cost of this item is shipping since they are basically shipping a pound of water ,1
the nifty coffee pod drawer is the perfect solution for me it sets nicely beside my keurig and holds k cups the drawers slide easily and have a catch so they do not fall out when fully opened the top is perfect for my sugar dispenser and extra mugs it is well made and worth the money the black mesh design fits any decor ,1
my gluten intolerance was utterly depressing no more pasta no more sandwiches the bionaturae gf pasta is pretty darn good and as a bonus it does not get mushy like those rice based pastas but that is another review for another day i live near berkeley and there are health food stores organic this and that farmer is markets etc but i never found a bread worth bothering with i can not tell you how many loaves of other breads simply wound up in my compost bin then a neighbor told me about udi is wow great texture does not crumble and a truly tasty flavor sometimes it is the simple things in life a sandwich is one of those things and thanks to udi is i can go there again as to another review that mentioned poor service from udi is i had just the opposite experience i got a loaf that had a giant air bubble in the middle of the loaf several pieces were crust a little bread and a hole the size of a golf ball through the rest of the piece i emailed the production batch info and they mailed a coupon for a free loaf they would had a production issue where this was happening a lot now corrected no more problems ,1
they are still sweeter than i would like but they taste less like candy than any other bar i have tried so they are my favorite they store well too you can carry them around in your bag or car and the constant temperature changes are not a big problem for them ,1

i saw a package of these strawberried peanut butter m m is in the check out line of a local grocery and decided to give them a try i love strawberries and though i enjoy the taste now and again i am not a huge fan of peanut butter the taste was delicious they are quite high in both calories and fat but with something this scrumptious that is to be expected just do not eat too many at one time these are supposed to be a limited time candy but i hope mars reconsiders and adds them as a regular candy ,1
this is a perfect match for a moka pot the grind is fine enough for a good extraction but not so fine that it chokes the machine or yields a bitter over extracted flavor it is smooth and rich with a hint of sweetness to it as with most lavazza varieties it is a medium roast which is the traditional northern italian style i usually drink decaf and buy whole beans but i keep a can of this handy for when i want a caffeinated cup or for guests highly recommend if you have a moka pot ,1
these are great that is all i can say they taste good they are crunchy they have a complex full flavor you can melt cheese on them or spread cream cheese on my day of an almost no carb diet i really depended on these little guys to substitute for crackers when i craved a snack mix some chopped green olives in some cream cheese add curry powder and chilli powder and you have got a great spread for these little crackers ,1
mimicreme is great bought it at a health food store in the spring but not at and change for oz either number of product per package is not listed or people must be willing to spend dollars per ounce ,1
my dog a german shepherd did not think much of these her favorite treat chicken jerky dog treats from a store that starts with c and ends with ostco she scarfs up very quickly and with real excitement enjoyment these blue dog treats she sniffs and will not take they do look tasty to me though to the point where i want to take a bite maybe i would like them more than my dog does ,0
when we visited turkey last xmas we drank straight or honey sweetened turkish tea along with delicious baklava several times a day to make up for the cold my boys fell in love with turkish tea there back home we tried to find some good turkish tea i ordered several kinds after doing thorough testing we decided that this was the best tea among the kinds we sampled the taste very clean and pure a light well pitched fragrant component a hint of sweetness in the background we brew it in a cast iron japanese tea kettle pour boiling water in it then dilute it in the glass or mug to the concentration we want purists beware we often sweeten it with honey and i typically add a drop of lemon ,1
have tried a few different peanut brittle is from amazon and this is by far the best it is loaded with peanuts plus being in a sealed tin makes it seem fresher wit minimal breakage ,1
mix durkee is sauce with real mayonnaise not miracle whip in roughly half to half proportions i use a little more mayo than durkee is then add curry powder to taste absolutely wonderful as a dip for raw vegetables i have made this dip for more than years and i have never had anyone say that they did not like it if you make it the day before the flavors meld together really well just give it a stir before serving but you must use durkee is sauce that is the secret ingredient i have also used durkee is instead of mayo when mixing canned tuna fish for sandwiches it adds a great zing to deviled eggs and it is also good over grilled salmon i would not be without it ,1
this had a weird gelatinous consistency i will stick with reduced fat mayo for only a few ww points ,0
i was really looking forward to this product but honestly the flavor is bad its drinkable ice cold but its not something i would pay for again ,0
this popcorn package is a great idea it has many flaws it is very difficult to pour the oil into the popcorn popper it is best when you heat the oil for minutes and then add the popcorn and seasoning the popcorn does not pop completely there are lots of left over kernels that never pop i am very disappointed in this product i will not purchase this product again ,0
gotta keep your expectations in check like all low carb foods but these are very decent tortillas flavor is on the whole grainy side but nothing too awful they work great in wraps for large tacos or you can crisp them for taco salad shells my preferred use is to crisp them for a low carb pizza crust which works very well if you enjoy a cracker thin crust and can trick yourself into believing it tastes remotely the same without these i would be a sad sad guy watching people eat their pizza while i eat a salad with pepperoni now i can stand tall and pretend a tortilla with cheese and pepperoni is a slice of pizza ,1
whew they do smell but seem to be what the cat likes he really seems to like them but i might caution if you have an older cat like mine who seems to have a little trouble with harder foods these treats are pretty hard overall a good product for kitty ,1
i have enjoyed folgers cappuccino french vanilla coffee for several years and i continue to enjoy it every day i am pleased to have amazon make it so convenient to keep it available for me ,1
amazon had this on sale and sent me an e mail the price was to good to pass up to be honest when i first tried a bar i thought it had a dark chocolate taste but not as bitter after the first bar i was hooked this chocolate is the smoothest and best tasting i have ever tried i am not a chocolate connoisseur but i know what i like and this is it the price is a little higher than what i paid but even at the listed price i will be buying more i might have to try the other kinds of chocolate bars from this maker this will also be something i will be giving to close friends and family for birthday and holiday presents ,1
i love coffee until i had eight o clock brand i never knew what excellent coffee was i only drink perked coffee because it has the full flavor i am looking for in a cup of coffee i buy my eight o clock at sam is club and grind it from whole beans in their grinder the aroma from the fresh opened bag makes me hurry home to make me a great cup of coffee i have a cup pot and i use heaping tablespoons of grounds per pot and it comes out very good thanks eight o clock for a great product ,1
i love the guayaki brand and had seen the chocolatte flavor online but never in stores until my last trip to mother is market where it was on sale for regularly i am glad i picked it up it is a great tea great flavor no sweetener needed but it tastes closer to chai to me than it does chocolate i add a tablespoon of organic cacao powder and some organic vanilla almond milk to make it a dessert tea ,1
i think these soups are great if you are not used to no salt added foods then you will find it bland but once you have a bowls of this soup regular soup with it is mg of sodium will taste like ocean water you can actually taste the flavor of the beans and herbs rather than just being saturated with salt the minestrone is my favorite of these soups and the potato leek my least favorite i would rate the lentil as my second favorite ,1
i like this cookies raspberry jam filling in the cookies tastes very good but it is too sweet for me ,1
as a newly diagnosed pre diabetic i have been looking for products that taste good and do not affect my sugar levels adversely this product seems to be doing the trick i can tolerate the taste but wish it tasted a little more sweet i know this is diffult for a diabetic diet but just thought i would mention it ,1
this is the greatest hot pepper sauce you will ever find to put on your sub in se penna and northern del sporting some of the best hoagie and sub shops in the country when those hot little italian counter girls look across the board at you and say you want peppers and you nod affirmative and they respond hot or sweet this is what they are talking about no sub especially an italian is complete without wickles sub sauce ,1

i ordered from amazon not from the other sellers who are much more than amazon this product is extremely good value the crackers i received were very fresh and tasted great will definitely order again ,1
i was diagnosed with type diabetes in january i managed to reduce my from to in three months right after i was diagnosed i was getting nowhere i could not figure out why my blood sugar would frequently shoot up to over at times even though i was avoiding carbs and sugar i would feel terrible when my blood sugar jumped like that and my vision would get blurry it was extremely scary due to the meds i was taking i was having some gastric distress so my physician put me on a liquid diet that consisted of sugar free jello low sodium msg free chicken broth and water still my blood sugar would frequently shoot up to almost i thought it had to be that my blood sugar meter was not working correctly during this time i had to have another lab test so when i went to the lab i asked them to test my blood sugar using an actual lab work up and at the same time i would test using my meter the lab test showed my sugar as and my meter said the head of the lab said that is very accurate for a home meter by this time i would been on that liquid diet for almost days so my blood sugar should not have been fluctuating like it was and if anything due to the medication i take it should have been on the low side i later found out it was from the sugar free jello i was eating though it says on the nutrition info that it has zero sugar and zero carbs the reality is that it is full of maltodextrin and because of the way the law reads food producers do not have to list maltodextrin on the nutrition information they only have to put it in the list of ingredients if you look at the label on splenda the kind that measures like sugar you will see that the first ingredient listed is maltodextrin which is a filler product it can be made from grain but is generally made from corn and it reacts every bit as strongly on the pancreas as table sugar and white bread as per my endocrinologist those with diabetes pre diabetes and a family history of diabetes should avoid maltodextrin it is hard on your pancreas and even if you are not prone to diabetes but are dieting ingesting maltodextrin adversely affects appetite because it reacts so strongly on the pancreas if you eat something sugar free and notice that you are soon very hungry after it is from the maltodextrin that is most likely in the product as it is added frequently to sugar free things my endocrinologist said to avoid sugar and maltodextrin but he said if you can not help yourself and feel you must eat something with either one of those in it then choose the one with table sugar because it is effect will be shorter term and less strong on your body than the maltodextrin i wish i would have known this before i was diagnosed with diabetes and maybe i could have avoided it or at least held it off longer there are chicken flavorings out there that do not include maltodextrin buy one of those instead ,0
the greatest tea ever i actually am a distributor of this product the only one in so cal but not being one sided better than any prescription drug on the market and better for you in the long term ,1
this product comes in tiny bags that contain little cubes of grounded cashews and chocolate the taste is mediocre i will not be back ,0

since reading the other reviews i decided to try this extra virgin olive oil it is subtle and delicious i keep it in conjunction with another that has a more pronounced olive flavor but i can not say enough good things about this seller the packaging is done so well i do not think anything could destroy the contents and this is the fastest shipping ever i will be visiting super olive just to see what else they carry because i would like to do more business with them ,1
i love the taste and smell of butter in my cooking this is really a good product without the added salt it flavors vegetables and anything i add it to ,1
first off i love the pyramid versus the regular tea bag i do not know why it works better but it does the leaves stay put so there is nothing floating around in the tea and the flavor is fantastic now as for this particular flavor blackberry vanilla it is amazing i can taste the blackberry and hibiscus flowers far more than the vanilla but since i love blackberries and the other flavorings blueberries and raspberries among others it is perfect for me i did not even have to add any sort of sweetener an added bonus the smell is heavenly ,1
i generally stay away from coconut water because they have strong smell and are expensive i was surprised when amazon offered this at a huge discount prompted me to order sets of they are fantastic i love them no after taste no strong smell great hydration after a run or workout ,1
could not tell you all the bags were defective what a waste of money all of the contents leaked in the water or my hand before i could get a taste of the bags of nothing waste of money listen if you do not you will be doing back flips trying to kick your own butt waste of money bags will not hold up to a soft rub ,0
the item shown on the page is not the item i received the item i received is the kind of soy sauce that they have in restaurants the ones that do not have a screw cap but rather a small hole on each side for pouring in other words you can not close the bottle i bought it for the purpose of transporting after using it but it is not possible fortunately the person i bought it for does not mind but beware that it is not the actual item they show on the buying page ,0
i was looking for a protein bar snack without yogurt chocolate the best granola bar ever without the wheat chewy not dry great flavor with seeds nuts dates great before and after a workout great wake up snack in the middle of the day ,1
i have tried numerous canned grain free foods for my cat roxie she just does not care for them i opened the can of paw lickin chicken food from weruva and she started eating right away and never stopped till it was all gone i was shocked she is always had a lot of allergies and has always been picky when it comes to canned foods so i was a happy camper when i saw how she took to weruva is food i contacted weruva via email to tell them how impressed i was and to inquire where i could just purchase some single cans instead of a complete case of each of their flavors to try on roxie they responded immediately actually the president of the company and co owner responded wow they were very helpful and gave me a lot of insight about cats and allergies and such i did order about different cans flavors from one of the websites they mentioned and am anxious to see how roxie does with the other flavors again i am very pleased with their food and the company itself will definitly order again ,1
my dog zoe recently has had to take pills a day instead of struggling with her to get them down she actually drools when i get the pill pockets out i do recommend giving your dog a couple of them without the pill beforehand because my dog usually spits out any new treat the first time sniffs it out chews it etc now she just gobbles it up they easily mold around the pill and i do follow the directions not touching the pill pocket with the fingers that touched the pill anyways it is been a week so hopefully the success will continue go pill pockets lol edit it is been weeks and still a success i do not even do the not touching the pill pocket with the fingers that touched the pill thing anymore plus i now break off pieces to fit around the small pills and large capsule pill pocket can be split to mold around capsules although this will vary in others ,1
i bought some small jars of this on a trip to beaune and thought enh mustard souvenirs from burgundy they are a good local travel gift but probably just average mustard wrong this is delicious my husband and i ate some with a grilled steak one night looked up at each other and said wow this is really good i never conisdered myself a mustard fan but this was so good i even ate a little straight out of the jar it is got a pleasant horseradish like heat to it that is not an ingredient though and it is not too vinegary like lots of other dijon mustards are we looked for every opportunity to use this polished off the little jar pretty quickly and finally found this larger size from the amazon seller pastacheese as soon as it arrived i cleaned out the fridge and threw out three other types of dijon mustard we had in there this is off the charts good ,1
this pasta is good but a bit on the bland side it is very filling and cooks very well one package goes a long way i like corn pasta better however but if you have a wheat allergy like i do check this pasta out ,1
i got hooked on these little peppers in mexico but they are next to impossible to find in the states i finally found them on amazon from the latin products at a great price to boot so i stocked up they arrived promptly well packaged and were as good as i rememeber them great if you have a taste for the spicy ,1
super tasty just alone but it is even better with some sweetener and the best is to get about of water put in heavy cream quite a bit and then sugar that is the magic tastes so good ,1
i have been a coffee snob since the mid i have done all but roast my own and was preparing to try that however my stomach is no longer into my deep and abiding love for really good coffee after i tried to stick with just tea for a couple of years a friend from england convinced me that instant coffee is worth at least a taste gasp i ordered some nescafe gold on his recommendation and it was actually good really good after happily drinking it for as long as my pocketbook would allow those pesky import costs i found this douwe egberts pure gold here on amazon i am not sure i will go back it is lovely i drink it hot and also cold in the summer time i pour about a cup of cold water into the grounds and let them sit for a few minutes give it a quick stir it even foams a little and then i add milk to fill the glass and a little evaporated cane juice although i still enjoy a good latte made right for daily drinking i do not think i will go back to home ground and brewed coffee just do not tell anyone ,1
the most delightful tea excellent for afternoon time alone and perfect for gift giving arrived on time and not even one tea leaf damaged ,1
i have tried several different brands for blackberry tea and this is my favorite it is very fragrant and has recognizable blackberry pieces and blossoms some other brands tend to smell and taste only purple ,1
i wanted to point out that these treats are different from the dog greenies dog greenies are chewy cat greenies are crunchy like dry cat food because of this i do not know if they actually work if they are the same texture what makes them different from cat food but i do not think they are dangerous as a previous reviewer said canine greenies have caused health problems but from what i understand it is because the dog did not chew it well like most dogs and because of the softer texture it swelled in the dogs stomach my cats love the salmon flavor the package recommends six pieces three times a day not to exceed pieces a day i give my cats about six a day all at once they do not always chew them though which is the only problem i have had with the product swallowing them whole does not bother my cats at all though i have one cat garfield who is very picky but he loves these treats so i think its probably safe to say that these should not cause health problems like the canine greenies can and also that your cat will really like them ,1
these crunchy little circles of cinnamon goodness are very filling and healthy they taste great and you can hardly tell that they are made primarily of sunflower seeds the only drawback is the oz bag contains two servings for a total of calories for those seeking a lower calorie snack definitely buy the oz serving to control portions if that is an area of concern overall these are a great alternative to chips or cookies and everyone in the family will enjoy them ,1
this is the tea i measure all other teas by the gold standard if you will prepared properly it makes excellent iced tea do not boil bags this makes a bitter brew hot it is a wonderful alternative coffee unless you are like me i do not drink coffee and it is my hot beverage of choice it is great to have a hot cup of tea first thing in the morning or any time i have tried other teas flavored herbal earl grey even sage tea nothing tastes as good to me as lipton tea so if you are a tea lover i would suggest you try this full bodied tea ,1
i remember these from childhood but i guess those memories are not that accurate these were very dry poor quality chocolate and mediocre marshmallow all combine to make an underwhelming product there are other mass market products that are similar but better such as the pinwheels also from nabisco there are also very high quality versions out there from small specialty manufacturers chocolate teacakes from the uk similar products from other countries they all seem to have some variation on this theme and there are even great recipes on the various food websites for the more adventuresome your kids may accept these as edible but why not give them something better ,0
such a tasty treat got these as a gift for my father in law and he loved them would definitely order again ,1
the bars i eat are almond coconut kind fruit nut they are wonderful i could eat these for every meal ,1
i usually buy in france but ran out bought some at wholefoods and just was not the finer quality i was looking for for baking this was excellent just like i usually buy in france ,1
been looking for spatini for a long time use to be able to get it out east but it got sold and was gone my friends and i are so happy we can find it again it is so yummy ,1
my kitties love most all of the canned fancy feast foods when i try to change between the sliced flaked grilled feast they have stomach issues so i only feed them certain feast flavors i buy this because most have the liver chicken beef etc listed as the first or second ingredient when i do want to treat them to something special i buy one of the other like flaked this way i stick with cat food instead of giving people food my cats give paws up ,1
naked crunchamame is simply perfect it is nice to have other spiced crunchamame but in my opinion nothing beats the simplicity of naked crunchamame ,1
i bought these trays because i was originally using plastic ice cube trays and they kept breaking everytime i would take the food out these trays work wonderful they slide right out and are the perfect portion size love them a little expensive but worth every penny ,1
on a gluten free diet the selection of normal side dishes is limited to rice potatoes or rice noodles overall this spices up the rice alternative a bit i have tried different flavors of the lundberg risotto this one is the most spicy with bounds of flavor ,1
first you put in the frother then the coffee should not it be the other way around i tried to put the coffee in first but the machine would not let me on the cafe setting you end up with an overly sweet cup of a milkly yucky substance stay away ,0
excellent rich dark and earthy i was disappointed by the usual k cups which gave me thin bland meh coffee but saw that emeril is coffee got good reviews here and by god they are right i still feel guilty about the waste involved with this system but if you re going to use keurig coffeemakers for their convenience and want coffee deserving of the name rather than weak bitter swill look no further ,1
i was really happy to find the red zinger tea bags available on amazon i looked in all the grocery stores around my house and it is gone i have an iced tea recipe using red zinger and apple juice which is delicious i do not drink the red zinger alone so i cannot evaluate it like that i certainly hope celestial seasonings has not discontinued it thank you so much for providing it on amazon i like that it is caffeine free here is the recipe and i hope it causes you to buy the tea so it will not be discontinued rose celestial seasonings red zinger large tea apple orange lemon slicesadd water to fill one gallon let sit for hours before serving plan ahead ,1
i have been testing all the soda stream flavor syrups i can find at my local retailers the cream soda syrup was hard to find i had good fond yummy memories of cream soda canada dry when i was growing up the soda stream cream soda is awful it taste like medicine the flavor is nothing of cream soda i would suggest you pass on this flavor ,0
i was excited by the extra cheesy on the box but did not pay enough attention to realize that it was not just more cheese powder which i think the non deluxe kind needs this cheese sauce while creamier is pretty disgusting ,0
no smell at all i hate walking into a house that smells like cat and this is the only litter i have used that does not create or cause that smell i have cats and of the ginormous pet mate litter boxes i use one bag and pour half of it in each box it lasts about and a half weeks before i have to change completely change it entire box of clumping clay litter lasted me only a week and its nasty and hard to clean so while this is slightly more expensive it lasts a lot longer i subscribed to the auto shipping and the price is only more than a box of clay clumping litter i highly recommend this stuff your cats and you will love it ,1
as a disclaimer i have a senseo coffee pod machine so of course the senseo pods fit quite well the problem with these pods is that they are not advertised for a specific machine but do not fit the senseo machines i have purchased all sorts of different pods to get different flavors or varieties that have fit the senseo machine just fine so why can not java one make pods that fit the pods are really good tasting er i mean the coffee in them but if you use them with the senseo they actually become dangerous breaking the lid seal and popping the top of the machine thus spraying hot water everywhere so senseo owners seek elsewhere ,0
kobe beef comes from a specific prefecture in japan and is illegal to import in to the united states in fact it has been illegal to import since in any form this is just overpriced regular american beef ,0
old london melba toast is good tasting if you like small pieces it is packed loosely in the box and so far out of boxes i have only found two slices not broken into pieces nothing like paying high dollar for toasted bread that is basically small pieces when you open it up they definitely need to work on their packaging ,0
i was not a huge granola fan until a friend turned me onto dr flynn is creation it is not only healthier than the rest but it tastes so much better the best of both worlds ca not get enough especially since it is organic thank you dr flynn ,1

ok so i want to start this by saying that we have been eating cocoa loco bars on an almost daily basis for about years my son can not eat wheat or dairy and he absolutely loves these little bars they have made a wonderful irreplaceable breakfast bar or snack for the car we also order cases of enjoy life granola and chocolate chips on a regular basis so this review is coming from someone who really likes their products fast forward to weeks ago we go onto amazon and see that the bars have been changed to a new recipe this really worried my son but we ordered a case and anxiously awaited their arrival the bars came and every single one was covered in green fuzzy mold yes we opened each and every bar in the whole case so instead of calling amazon i called the company direct feeling like they should know about this asap i talked to a representative from the company and she said that they already knew about the mold but it had been too late and a few cases were sent to customers she said that they would send a replacement case asap i was so happy and figured that we could expect the new bars in a few days wks passed and i realized we had not received the new case sent a long email to the company telling them how disappointed i was and after a few days i got a one line email saying the case would ship today no explanation no apology nothing so i will not hold my breath about the replacement and i sincerely hope this company works on their public relations skills i would not have even written this email if someone just admitted that they had dropped the ball and apologized the allergy community definitely needs good brands and hopefully this one will improve ,0
this is probably some of the best chocolate i have tasted i actually bought it at a store in toronto and the bar was old and white it was still better than any chocolate that i have tasted and i have probably had about different labels highly recommended,1

i ordered this k cup coffee on the favorable reviews of others but taste is subjective and this particular flavor of coffee has not made any impression on me it is not horrible it is simply average and it has not captured my attention because of that when i finish the last pod i will not re order it ,0
i have a very picky yr old german shepherd that leaves anything but a milkbone on the floor to collect dust she loved this bone i was amazed to see her crunch it up the large bone so quickly she is always been very well disciplined until these bones arrived at least she went into my pantry and tore the bag open and ate bones she had such a low hung head when i approached her about the issue all i could do was laugh luckily my month old shephard got one before her sister ate the batch i save about ordering the bones on amazon ,1

most of the flavoring products i have had always leave an aftertaste that seem to bother me mio liquid does not so that already made me happy the mango peach is a good blend that i found enjoyable and i would be interested in sampling the other flavors that they have to offer the fact that it comes in a liquid form is nice too because powder can be so messy i also like the small packaging size which makes it each to pack when your traveling ,1
this is a great salt and fantastic way to add complex flavors to anything needing an extra kick for smoked flavoring it only takes the smallest of portions to taste a fantastic smoked hickory flavor ,1
i have had a goldendoodle puppy for about two months the dog is months old the first weeks after i used this product i had no problems the past two weeks hoewever have been tough after ruling out a possible infection i determined that the this product was causing diarrhea to my dog when reading the nutirent information this kibble is very rich in protein and fat i think my dog is stating to change and the food is no longer agreeing with him ,0

like a few of the people who wrote a review i was born and raised on a carribbean island barbabdos to be exact when i came here i tried to find coconut water that actually was coconut water and guess what one coconut water is exactly that it taste like the young fresh coconut water that it clams to be from loook at the ingrediants no additives just coconut water there is a difference between young coconuts and more aged coconuts the older ones are much sweeter but the young ones are more refreshing and much healthier so if you dont know what you talking about its not right to leave a negative review because to really know the difference between coconuts you actually would have to taste the orginal product cut fresh and drink it out the nut one thanks i always crave coconut water during pregancy because there is nothing better than young cocnut water to keep a mother and her baby healthy and you have given me something wonderfull ,1
i got this as a gift for someone else but only because i have my own bottle at home and love it ,1
i tend to enjoy the spicier condiments and am a big salsa eater that said i prefer a good many of my dressings and sauces to have a bit of a kick usually when i get takeout that includes fries or something else equally dipable i just use ranch or ketchup but this spicy ranchero sauce has managed to insert a decent enough burn to it is ranch esque flavor to make me happy i have so far enjoyed it on fries tots and chicken fingers and it is been so much more flavorful than the standard condiment fare cheers tb i am not a fan of your regular menu but your ranchero sauce is a ok in my book ,1

these memorial yahrzeit candles by rokeach definitely last longer than some of the cheaper ones i can get in a supermarket i agree with the reviewer who writes that these always burn for a few hours longer than hours that makes these a superior brand of memorial candle the candle burns well and safely after you light it but i usually place it on a dish on my stove or any other surface that is not flammable just in case highly recommended ,1
we really like newman is own products we also like these but the taste is not consistent it starts out nice and you can taste the pomegranate but as it sits in the mouth it begins to taste like cough syrup a bit just enough to be slightly off putting overall good product but not one you will want to buy multiple packs of ,1

i can not believe this i walked down to the local independent pet supply on amission to get my pound siberian kitten a corner scratcher but i foundtaste of the wild rocky mountain formula instead i would been meaning to try it for my kitty but i could not find it anywhere i read some reviews about it and was pretty convinced that it is nutritionallysound healthy and tasty but nothing prepared me for my sweet docile if abit enormous kitten attacking the bowl i mixed a little in with his regular food purina kitten chow because you arenot supposed to switch their food abruptly or their tummies could get upset he ate right around the kitten chow to get at the little venison and salmonnuggets i think cats are smarter than we are sometimes they know what is healthy for themand often prefer it to junk food this is a total winner and when i use up that purina kitten chow bag i am gettinga huge bag of taste of the wild for my fuzzboy ,1
really lovely flavors and not too hot i usually go for far hotter sauces than this one but make an exception here as this is amongst my favorites i am basically addicted to it a real winner with clean and distinct flavors ,1

my shih tzu has had tummy problems for most of the years since i adopted her she had an ongoing vomiting acid tummy spit up problem that completely ruined the carpets in my home the vet was helpful in some respects indicating that it was probably an allergy to the food she was eating even though it was very high quality food but it was a neighbor who had been through the same thing with her now older border collie when he was young that really got me on the right path what is that right path natural balance products missy now eats the natural balance vegetarian dry food because it is one of their allergy products and i just recently started supplementing the dry food with this duck and potato formula dog treat roll it is intended to be used as a treat during training and i am sure we will get to that eventually but for right now it is the icing on the cake to motivate missy to eat her food i cut one small slice off the roll and then cube it very small and mix it in with her food she goes bonkers for it if i was not sick with the flu right now i would have done a video of her reaction the roll comes in at least two sizes that my pet food store carries this wonderful little roll and its much bigger cousin i am averse to the smell and look of canned dog food so i avoid it except when it has been necessary for missy to have prescription food when she is been sick what i loved about this roll is that it really does not look or smell like dog food at all it smells sort of like duck jerky and looks and has the texture of a firm salami it is firm enough to slice and dice very easily most importantly my dog loves it and ever since i started mixing it into her food my picky eater who just grazed the top layer off her food to get whatever special stuff was on top is now snarfing down the bowl and leaving very little i got all new flooring in my home last month and missy is a changed dog thank you natural balance for realizing that not every dog can eat chicken and beef and that some dogs have tummy or allergy problems requiring other options ,1

as a non coffee drinker purchasing coffee for the office has been a challenge i can only rely on best selling ratings user reviews what feedback i manage to get from my coffee guys in the office i guess this one is not for the super strong coffee people but if you like a milder blend you should give it a whirl several of my guys had positive things to say about this one,1

this shampoo does first of all what shampoo ought to do it cleans my hair that is a positive however this shampoo also claims to help nourish and replenish the scalp leading to healthier hair i can tell some of this seems to be happening but honestly my hair is too short to really notice the benefits it is definitely effective for my dandruff that much is clear to me so it works well as an anti dandruff and does seem to provide the healthier hair look and feel but if you are hair is fairly short and simple you might not notice much besides the lack of flakes ,1
the moths walk right on through it was easier and you kill my more moths byt running around with a flyswatter ,0
if you use sparkling water this peach nectarine talking rain sparkling water would be a nice choice for you if you are just plain thirsty in my experience this product quenches your thirst quickly to me the peach taste and aroma are quite good ingredients are carbonated water essences from natural fruit oils and extracts all natural no calories no sweeteners sodium free a case of groups of cans each with plastic loops for every cans arrived in fine condition with lots of padding in a large cardboard box no dents no loose cans no spills delivery was quick some of the reviews remind me of my first experience with sparkling water years ago when i discovered that plain sparkling water has no flavor i am grateful for the peach nectarine flavor in this and like the motto on each can as in life chill for best results in addition for the record i drink this slowly since it is carbonated always a varied adventure with carbonation,1
i like the stronger flavor of the amber madhava organic agave nectar my son in law likes the lighter with its milder taste but whichever you prefer madhava is the leader because i use it a lot and find the bottles easier to handle than larger bottles the suits me just fine the flip top makes it even more convenient an odd benefit of using agave nectar is that while it is sweeter than sugar and has slightly more calories than sugar per tsp it is lower on the gi scale you can use it just as you would use honey but i like the flavor better and there is no aftertaste i like to use it on pancakes as well as in tea or cooking baking i recommend this product to anyone who has a sweet tooth ,1
i love tea this latte tastes wonderful it s not too spicy and has just the right amount of sweetness the latte is as easy to make it is just like making hot chocolate in a few days all of the mix was gone in my home because i live in canada there is no trader joe is around so i bought this set of trader joe is spicy chai latte to enjoy myself this latte can be enjoyed cold or hot which i personally love buy at least one tin of the chai latte and i know that you will really like it trader joe is spicy chai latte is the best ,1

these are your classic honey maid graham crackers a long time snack favorite repackaged into smaller packets this makes some sense with fewer crackers per packet the others stay sealed where they will not get stale also each packet is now a handy size that could fit in a pocket or a purse you might want to think about how graham crackers are consumed in your household to see if this is a good fit do you go through packages fast or slow if fast then the staleness concerns may not even be a consideration would it be handy for you to take a packet on the go as a snack if you are only going to eat them at home the smaller packet size will be less important to you ,1
tasty yummy great glad that i bought some will get more when i need more just that as a dieabetic ,1
absolute best pepper i have ever tasted i have paired it up with the ozeri graviti pro electric pepper mill and grinder which i also got on amazon i have always loved pepper but this combo has taken my ethusiasm to a whole new level plus pepper has the health benefits of anti oxidants and vitamin c i will never be without this fantastic peppercorn when they say it is gourmet it is definitely the truth ,1
we actually found out about this brand while dining at a restaurant that offered gf penne pasta when we got the dish we called our waiter and told him we believe they made a mistake and served us the regular pasta instead of the gf pasta and the chef came out with the pasta wrap so we can see for ourselves needless to say that was the end of the rest of the brands notry outs it can not get better tan this ,1

i wrote a review just yesterday regarding diamond is so called natural lite lamb and rice dog food i was shocked to read that powdered cellulose was one of the top ingredients well guess what powdered cellulose is in this natural cat product as well why would any caring cat owner feed his or her beloved pet powdered cellulose i guess diamond has to use some kind of filler in order to reduce the amount of real food powdered cellulose is certainly cheaper than chicken and after all it is all about the money moreover the lb bag arrived in a cardboard box that looked as if it had been dropped from an aircraft and the bag itself was split approximately a pound of food was loose and leaking from the box shame on diamond for its awful ingredient and on amazon for its crummy packaging and shipping i am stuck with a split bag of awful food and the bill for it as well do not make the same mistake as i did ,0

these cherries have good flavor and are a great value compared to the fancy jars they usually sell them in if you can find them at all just put them in your own glass jars and you can share with friends and because of the high sugar content of the syrup they will keep well especially in the fridge update may i ate the last of the refrigerated cherries about a week ago with no ill effects they were still delicious and i just packed the new batch in six oz jelly jars with a little syrup left over to drizzle on ice cream in the next few days ,1
this cookie hits just the right note for lemon lovers not too sweet with a nice tangy flavor and no bitter or artificial taste it does have a granular texture from the brown rice flour but that does not mean this is a dry cookie at all it sort of melts in your mouth ,1
sense memories evocative of one is childhood are just too strong to fight against such is the strength of the delicious aroma that greeted me when i ground my first sample of this bean it took me back to my six year old self waiting in line with mother at the a p smelling the grind of the eight o clock beans that were being pulverized in that giant red machine have i had better coffee in my life yes did i pay much more for it also yes however this is the best i can find for this price point for me i like a dark aromatic roast a healthy long shelf life and a coffee that will stand lingering in the pot for over an hour in case i forget about it and not turn into bitter motor oil sludge for these my three critical desires in a coffee this coffee is the perfect everyday bean ,1
silk is usually absolutely delicious but it contains cane juice which translates to sugar besides for which the plain flavor does not taste nearly as good as the others between the unrefined organic naturally milled all that good stuff sugar and the not great taste my take on this kind of silk is especially thanks but no thanks ,0
i love dipping oils spices and this is one of my favorites it has a little bit of a salty taste because of the cheese but i like that in my dipping spices the flavor is full and not heavy ,1

rev sylvester graham created the original graham crackers as part of a diet based on the theory that one could curb one is sexual appetite by eating bland foods wikipedia graham cracker accessed mar crackers are true to the spirit of rev graham is intent they are devoid of flavor and possess the texture of the most delicate particle board while nutritious in the strictest sense there is a surprising amount of salt or of the daily value per grams of cracker while not noticably salty it baffles me why they bothered to add salt when they had clearly passed on any other flavor and eating even one suppressed any urge to take pleasure in life do not bother unless these are going to be used as some form of punishment e m van courtp s i noticed among the tags recycled that would explain a lot v,0

as many reviewers have stated it tastes like coffee in a can but let is be honest that is exactly what it is and for what it is i found it to be pretty delicious i typically like my coffee with a little sugar and whole milk or cream depending on the type of coffee i was worried that this cappuccino would be too bitter but was pleasantly surprised it had just the right amount of sweetness and milk the can makes it very portable with no worry of breakage as with the starbucks frappiccino is so if you need to toss it in your bag for a little caffeine boost later you are good to go ,1
eight o clock whole been coffee has been a favorite of mine for years i grind enough for the week and keep it in an air tight jar the eight o clock coffee company has different style beans available to suit all tastes while i prefer the colombian bean style which has a rich bold balanced flavor the milder smooth french roast is also a great choice so whats better than a great cup of coffee first thing in the morning its a good coffee at a great price delivered to your door every month the price offered for the subscription service was to good to pass up though i was a bit hesitant to click i am glad i did coffee comes every month but not before i get an email from amazon asking if i still want the subscription do you need an extra bag do you have to much right now and want to skip a month the bag is the perfect size for my needs and at it beats walmart is price by,1
after tasting the taco bell chipotle sauce which was very good i thought that the other varieties would be at least good wrong this supposed spicy ranchero was actually bland sort of like liquified cardboard might taste i let some people i know taste it and they agreed with me i threw it out not recommended ,0
i tried this salsa on a whim while shopping at wegman is i absolutely fell in love with it it has a homemade taste it is smoky meaty not watery and the heat is not overpowering alas i have not seen it on the shelves because the store told me people complained about it i can not believe it but i suppose everyone has their own taste maybe those people like processed watery bland salsas ,1

the label says that you can make this risotto in minutes it took me about and there was still a bit more liquid than i would like i finally decided to just let it sit on the cooling burner to absorb the last bit of liquid the flavor however is excellent cheesy but not overpoweringly so i would definitely order it again ,1

we have been a fan of oliotaibi oils for several years now we have purchased more than forty bottles of oil over the years and have never been disappointed since all have been of the finest quality with a rich taste and excellent consistency perfect for salads or for dipping bread or drizzling over buffalo mozzarello glad to see the product is now available through amazon which makes order processing even easier well worth the price ,1
we are almost out of this coffee so i know i have to order it again or i will be missing it is wonderful smooth flavor i do not consider it a strong french vanilla flavor just enough of a hint to make it extra special the aroma is the best it is so delicious that i even love setting it up i will probably order this with a subscription and save a little extra money ,1

i was needing to accomplish some much needed catch up in order to prepare for month end i sat down at my desk to do some input with a red rain energy shot at hand instead of my normal afternoon cup of joe and broke the seal twisted the cap and finished it in one gulp as far as energy drinks go i found red rain berry flavor to be amazingly better tasting than any other tried to date sweet and lip smacking good it had none of the bitter aftertaste i have immediately experienced with other brands in the energy burst department i discerned no noticeable buzz however after hunkering down and keying away for about ten minutes i realized that i felt more alert and it seemed i was plowing through the data a bit more quickly two hours later i was completely finished and proofing my entries no errors if you brew your own with a french press every morning or regularly line up for a vente sized caffeine fix you might not notice much of an energy burst from a red rain energy shot but i think you will notice better focus and attention to detail as i did maybe it is red rain is combination of b vitamins amino acids and enzymes that make the difference as compared to just drinking coffee maybe it is all in my mind either way i feel as if i worked smarter and faster with the help of red rain and intend on keeping a few of these puppies in my desk drawer for crunch times ,1
while not so quick as minute oatmeal the wait is worth it in my opinion this was how oatmeal was meant to be enjoyed i will never go back to the boxed variety the texture is appealing and the taste has a slight hint of nutty flavor such a shame i had not tried this many years ago i did not know what i had been missing ,1
we have purchased this exact kit from amazon in the past this kit was great every function we went to we brought a bottle and it was a big hit everybody loved it if you are new to wine making this kit has everything you need to make and bottle your wine but you must have all of the associated supplies already example the bottles carboy hydrometer and corker ,1
we adopted a mix breed that was approx year old his coat was coarse dry and skin was flaky he was licking his feet and shaking his head tried several brands and found that duck and lamb make him extremely gassy with a really rude odor he loves the fish and sweet potato his coat is like velvet now in just a couple short months no more shedding or flaking and no rude odorous gas problem highly recommend ,1
i would have given these four stars for flavor if they had not been hard as rocks to be fair i did buy them on clearance here and warehouse deals did give me a refund if you suck on these for a very long time they are tasty it is just that you could break a tooth if you tried to chew on them right out of the package i am thinking they are probably just old stock and fresh ones would be chewy and lovely the flavor is good and they are adorable ,0
everytime i make these my boyfriend eats half the pan in one sitting they are sooooo yummy i cook them for a little less than the recommended time and take them out when theyre still gooey and let them set for minutes food continues to cook even after removed from oven fyi they still stay nice and gooey but not falling apart highly recommend ,1

i am sure i do not need to enumerate to this customer base the benefits of green tea we have seen it in our family over and over again appetite control nutrients energy healing properties the list could go on however green tea alone is not exactly going to win any taste tests for the uninitiated the whole family enjoys this bigelow jasmine brew we consume it in criminal quantities because it lacks the bitterness of other green teas it is light flavorful and inviting add it to your amazon shopping list and you will not be disappointed ,1

love the ease of having green natural tea anywhear any time tastes great i love this stash green tea,1
this is my first nonw book review but when amazon offered this for the vine review program i could not resist i love me some tea for me tea and books go hand in hand so this random review does not seem so strange now on to the tea most chai teas in the bag are flavor flat however this one by higgins burke is very flavorful while i let the chai seep in the hot water there was a nice and strong aroma when i simply hold a tea bag in its individually sealed package close to my nose i still get a great sense of the flaovers the tea goes down well and this is no lingering bitter after taste it also taste great iced ,1
the seller was great order came on time and we were happy with it i would suggest putting a better description i did not realize they had a vanentine theme but it did work for what we are using them had they been for something specific i would not have been happy candy was fine though ,1
i like pop secret microwave popcorn so i thought i would try the jar of popping corn well it is tough chewy and the hulls are huge and overly plentiful i really was disappointed i popped it in a whirly pop which is my new favorite way to pop popcorn but the results were disappointing out in the trash it goes i found crown jewel popcorn on the web they have varieties and the corn is tender and has minimal hulls and best of all they all taste fantastic i still have yet to put anything but salt on it skip this stuff and buy the good stuff it is worth it ,0
we try not to give our cats treats so as to promote their dental and physical health of course they get bored with their cat food and whine for something different these treats work nicely in terms of changing the menu up in a healthy way ,1
i eat a lot of raw cashews mainly when i am trying to diet and thought i would save myself some money by ordering these in bulk unfortunately they were no good i read the reviews on amazon for this item and one person felt the same as i do but another review pawned the first dissapointed review off on the fact that of course raw cashews are not as good as roasted ones i am here to tell you that i know what raw cashews taste like and these were no good ,0

my dog has food issues nothing stayed down or she became uninterested halfway through the bag so far natural balance is the only dog food she has consistently ate without problems good job natural ,1
i dont know that these naked coconut waters are the best on the market i have found that i personally like vita better but that doesnt mean these arent bad far from it they go down quite easily actually and are very refreshing one thing i have noticed about the naked brand of coconut waters in general and this lychee one specifically is the additional flavor is more of a complementary flavor than a standout one so in this beverage the lychee while noticeable is pretty much a blend with the coconut water flavor very pleasing i would note also that coconut water can be an acquired taste especially for people who generally drink sodas and the like and blends like this can help a person ease their way into drinking straight coconut water as a final observation i think the ounce portion size is perfect just enough to satisfy me personally i can even forgive that this is a pepsico product actually i kind of hope the mega corps see the profitability in producing actual healthy beverages and will start or continue to provide these as alternatives to the other c p on the market enjoy ,1
my husband i are loving the cases of gloria jean is butter toffee each month you think we have a problem love the taste ,1
this sauce goes with everything it is not too spicy once you get the first couple pours out of the bottle mae ploy is is the best i have had although any brand will probably be good ,1
i made the mistake of purchasing this bag on amazon is subscribe and save deal figuring it would be a good deal lesson learned no returns allowed on subscribe and save i learned that important point after the product arrived the garbanzo beans were filled with bug holes and many of them are eaten away by beetles or whatever species of insect they are still crawling in the plastic bag how can someone clear this product for sale thee bug holes are clearly visible through the clear plastic bag and there is a pile of bug eggs larvae garbanzo dust at the bottom of the bag very disappointed as if the bug infestation was not bad enough many of the beans are also shriveled meaning they will not re hydrate properly the beans also have a generally unfresh odor as if they were sitting on a warehouse floor for months which they probably were i will not be purchasing any products from taste specialty foods again clearly quality is not a hallmark of this company be warned ,0
in court as i understand it you are not supposed to testify about anything where you do not have direct experience you can discount this review if you want since i have only second hand experience with this soup i gave a case of this soup to a young friend who is a college student i worry about her starving she never mentioned whether she liked the soup so i asked she finally admitted that it was to quote her the worst thing i have ever tasted apparently her boyfriend also tried it and thought it was bad as well while my friend is rather picky her boyfriend has a much wider culinary range so if they both disliked the soup i am inclinded to think it is not very good ,0

buying these vanilla beans on amazon is the best way to buy them they are cheap yet they are very plump the grocery store gives you two sad beans for the same price if you use vanilla beans in any of your cooking this is definitely the place to buy them ,1
i ordered this item about two months ago and the price has sky rocketed it is actually cheaper to purchase it from the neighborhood corner store it is a great product and i notice the difference when i do not drink it ,1
i have changed to a healthier way of eating so i had to give up white rice which as a hispanic is a basic staple in our diet i found this rice in a discount store once and i liked it much better than the more commonly sold long grain i find this short grain cooks a lot softer than the long and medium grain rice amazon sold this for about the same price as bob is red river but without the exorbitant shipping charges i was thrilled to be able to use the super saver shipping option which shipped for you can find everything on amazon com makes my life much easier ,1

i noticed lingonberries were recommended by dr oz with a number of healthy properties and ordered two different preserves the other was twice the price of this but the taste was the same and this one had less water basically sugar juice in it i would be happy with either but given the large price difference i will reorder this one the taste was excellent i always prefer less added sugar and would wish for even less but this is delicious has a nice fresh taste too ,1
it is great productand awesome price i purchase it because my family trying to lose weight without losing the flavor of koolade and sugar my husband is weight lose of was successful by switching to crystal light no sugar ,1
i tried this as i had previously tried the brownie mix which is outstanding it was easy to mix up love the wide variety of choices concerning the added ingredients and when it came out of the oven omg i was going to start experimenting with gluten free corn bread recipes but now i will not bother the mixes are kind of pricey but as a special treat they are well worth it ,1
i have a old keeshond who i would classify as a moderate chewer i bought her this bone because she enjoys chewing things with a little bit of give and the durachew nylabones seemed to be too hard to hold her interest for extended periods indeed after some insecurity about this bone my keeshond took to it just fine she seemed to enjoy lying on the floor munching away on it for several minutes at a time after the first session i saw that her favorite chewing end had begun to fray but the instructions stated that such fraying is normal and that the surface of the bone is designed to fragment into small pieces the size of a grain of rice which are miniscule enough to pass through the dog is digestive tract without creating any dangerous or life threatening obstructions however after only a couple more chewing sessions i noticed that her favorite chewing end was wearing down to the point that nearly an entire nub was gone luckily for both of us i never left her unattended while she was chewing on this bone earlier today during one of her play sessions with the bone i looked down and saw the bone lying on the floor with my dog standing above it chewing on and trying to swallow something the thing she was chewing on fell out of her mouth and i quickly swooped in to pick it up it was a piece of the bone substantially larger than a grain of rice about an inch long by half an inch wide though i cannot say for sure that a piece of such size could cause a bowel obstruction i did not want to take any chances the packaging advises the dog owner to throw the bone away as soon as large pieces begin to break off and i did just that look my dog is not a pit bull she is a keeshond keeshonden are not known for being aggressive chewers and although i will concede that my dog definitely enjoys chewing on things she is not more of a chewer than an average dog and there is no world in which she can be considered a powerful chewer this bone only lasted for a week of occasional chewing it should have stood up to more punishment i only gave it a second star because my dog genuinely seemed to like chewing on it otherwise i consider this bone a safety hazard if you do choose to buy this bone make sure you always supervise your dog when he is chewing it so that you can stop him if he starts to break larger pieces off the instructions probably only give this warning for the purpose of waiving the company is liability but they are right ,0
my wife would not touch them but i found them to be the perfect after dinner snack the cat also finds them to be quite delightful they do a great job of keeping the cat is teeth clean ,1
i was one of those people who was looking into all things raw imagine my delight when i found out that you could eat chocolate like a supplement by eating raw cacao nibs well like all new things it is best to wait to purchase until you have all the facts raw cacao is high in oxalic acid which inhibits absorption of calcium as well raw cacao contains theobromind theophylline and caffeine which all mess with your central nervous system gastrointestinal system cardiovascularand endocrine system when i ate these i got the jitters and headaches i thought that i would suffer through the jitters the dirt taste and the sudden addiction to chocolate in the name of health it was not until kevin gianni of renegade health did a piece about how he no longer was going to recommend cacao because of health issues he was getting after he praised it that i started looking into if i should consume any more cacao i got sick of being jittery so i quit and have not looked back ,0
my husband and i both love this i buy it at walmart and it is deffinately cheaper my walmart has this at for a dollar ,1
very tasty candies these are definitely heavy on candy light on ginger i would actually say these just have a hint of ginger in them to my taste these do not compare at all to other ginger candies that immerse you in more of a raw ginger flavor if you are looking for that go with gin gin these are more like hard candy versions of grandma is spice cake still very yummy individually wrapped and about the diameter of a dime these are very portable and convenient i have also found that the ginger is a quality and amount that settles my stomach after meals ,1
home style just like grandma used to make right no the central substance of this product is a bag full of that gel like cheese goo just like the v brand adding tablespoons of butter and a little milk as per the directions does not change the end product much it also includes a tiny bag of white powder i am not sure what that is but it does not help any either the normal box of dry mac and cheese is better than this stuff if you want to improve upon the classic mac and cheese box just make it as per the directions and then stir in cup of shredded real cheese and about cup of extra milk then let it sit on the stove at low heat for about or minutes and you have got that oven baked cheesiness ,0
my sister is alergic to wheat so i make her a lot of gluten free foods i searched local stores and could not find sorghum flour so i looked on amazon and finally found it it was all packed wonderfully and arrived perfectly fine and i am already using it ,1

this is a terrific product it keeps for months and it is very easy to store because of the size and shape of the packaging chill a carton of it shake it up pour it drink it and i defy anyone to tell it from fresh whole milk from the store in fact it is much better than some of the milk in the grocer is dairy case this is rich flavorful milk from cows on good pasture we use it for drinking and for cooking i would recommend it to anyone i hope we will always be able to order it through amazon too because it is wonderful have it delivered right to the door i am old enough to remember having a milkman who did that ,1
very nice holds a couple of weeks worth of k cups with a very small footprint important in a place with small counter tops i gave it stars instead of because it it only designed to hold k cups rather than the advertised ,1
this was by far the best coffee that i have gotten so far simply wonderful great flavor good aroma very tasty so much in fact that we used it as our dessert ,1

this granola is fantastic low in sugar and the banana adds alot of flavor buying this product in packs was a great savings will be buying this alot ,1
nice decorative box of variety teas great to use or give as a small gift ,1
personally i think this is very expensive for what you get but then again my grandmother loved it she must have went through it like times reminiscing before she ate anything i suppose overall it is a good deal who knows how long it would have taken me to find all this candy separately ,1
this is a great pancake mix with home made taste the buttermilk style is difficult to find in local stores ,1

it is impossible to find this cheese in our dinky little town and it is fabulous this is original string cheese the stuff people bought before kraft and the like mass produced a version this is nothing like the plastic flavorless sticks that pass as string cheese now this is light flavorful and oh so yummy you will not disappointed ,1
from reading the previous review you would think these things are like liquid gold to each his her own of course but i just do not understand i found these candies pretty awful to be honest the only passable flavors strawberry and peach accounted for a total of out of candies i actually counted the majority was green apple which was the most bland apple flavor i have encountered in a candy the banana tastes so artificial it is sickening and the grape barely had a flavor at all not to mention the many loose wrappers half wrapped candy and loose candy floating in the bad i found myself checking for razors like some sicko on halloween who buys into urban legends it just was not a good scene i would say if you are looking for fruit chews look elsewhere just my opinion of course ,0
i would say my family is addicted to oatmeal including my two very young children we eat oatmeal at least days a week for breakfast and sometimes the kids want it for dinner this oatmeal is amazing after purchasing it many times at our local grocery store i decided to see if i could score it cheaper on amazon and sure enough i did this oatmeal is delicious not only for kids but for adults too it has chunks of real fruit in it and has wonderful flavor i love that it is organic and is now made with less sugar then before i recently started making huge batches of homemade oatmeal since we go through so much but i still order and keep this on hand for a variation great oatmeal you will not be sorry if you choose any country choice organic oatmeal ,1
you get enough in each package to make a good size cup of drink it is consistent in its flavor and the amount you get in each packet i have purchased it a couple of times ,1

i grew up near philadelphia with these oyster crackers crunched up in oyster stew a cheap dinner during the depression as an adult i saw them on bars where you crushed them with your hands to split them and donned them with horse radish great with a drink now i am in vermont and no one has ever heard of them i get them from home keep em coming daisy,1
in truth i am not a big fan of these squeeze bottle water flavorings often i find it hard to control the quantity and under flavoring makes the drink taste like a flat soda whereas over flavoring is just too sweet this larger bottle however seems to give just the right amount of flavor if you use two fingers to squeeze until it becomes too hard to squeeze anymore and the spout seals tight and effectively to prevent drips and spills the overall flavor is your typical fruit punch y flavor and there is only that faintest hint of chemicals to suggest the caffeine taurine and vitamins it contains the pick up it provides is mild i would say about the same as a cup of coffee or can of diet soda i do not think the other stuff in it is particularly strong or useful to my body as far as recovery times strength building electrolyte supply etc still i use this as my flavoring of choice on rest and light workout days with,1
it is so hard to find tasty healthy low sodium products in the stores i knew this line carried them but i have not seen them sold elsewhere i was so glad to find them on amazon and to find out the prices were fair the soup has a nice flavor and is great for a last minute meal when you are tired or in a hurry i only wish they carried the other flavors besides the garden vegetable ,1
greasy plain and simple it does relieve itchy scalps but the negatives outweigh the positives you can see through your hair that your scalp is shiny and you hair looks like covered with canola oil uncomfortable feeling you always have the feeling to stay away from the couch speciall ours is microfiber removing it is also a struggle as it sticks to your scalp and hair ,0
i really like this soup and i am typically not a big vegetable soup eater the one thing i want to mention is that in the ingredients i believe yeast extract is just another name for msg ,1
regardless of the for cents preprice on this item this is a great value these same size taffy ropes are each at all gas stations and convenience stores these are a lot less sticky than the flat samller taffy pieces by laffy taffy and my kids loved them great for vbs prizes stocking stuffers and birthday party favors ,1
although i am not the sardine eater in the family i might actually eat these my husband eats sardines times a week and he liked these bumble bee sardines in water very much i noticed right away that they were not as stinky as the other brands he was previously buying i may try the version in tomato sauce as i know i should be eating sardines ,1
great sausage but a little too much garlic for me the heat was ok but the snap and texture still makes it very good sausage i also likea more vinegar taste but that was easily cured i will buy more ,1
my son loves it i think it is his favorite out of the three brands of baby food we have tried you can not beat the packaging very convenient ,1
first i want to say that this is my favorite flavor of coffee it is perfect in the morning but the reason i am giving it a poor score is because out of the k cups i could only enjoy maybe half of them since it seemed like every other cup had the coffee grinds in it can someone tell me if they had similar problems or if the people that make the k cups or coffee can fix this please we do not want to have to switch to something else thanks for reading ,0
i agree with the other reviews that this was a wark blend taste you cant taste the glazed donut i will not be buying this type again they need to do better with this one ,0
we use agave in our coffee every morning and its also used in a variety of recipes we have tried different brands of agave and find this brand to be the best quality ,1
i received this order of xylitol with all pouches in perfect condition and already i have used it up i love the taste and find that not only is the blood sugar reaction much more gentle than standard cane sugar but after a month or so of eating it consistently i find it to be far more satisfying in general a tip for sensitive people especially those with candida issues since xylitol kills yeast try only a little bit at first and slowly work your way up before cooking with large amouts a couple interesting things i noticed while cooking with it is after eating pounds of xylitol a month there was no weight gain though the equivalent in cane sugar would have done so and i have noticed my food keeps for ridiculously long amounts of time i do not know if this is the xylitol specifically or another ingredient but it seems to be this sugar overall since this natural sweetener is safe eaten in moderation and in fact beneficial give it a chance even if it does not become your only sugar xylitol is excellent to have on hand ,1
the good eco friendly packaging less expensive per cupthe bad stale tastewhile i was excited to see the innovative packaging of this new product it just does not taste good it tastes likes the coffee is stale which makes sense considering that the coffee is exposed to air i realize the packaging reduces the amount of exposed air but it does not matter the taste speaks for itself ,0
greenies are an excellant way to whiten your dogs teeth the costs were much lower here than what you can buy locally at the dog food stores they have made a great improvment in my dog s breath tarter and overall mouth smell ,1
this is my family is favorite flavor i love the texture and consistency of this mix highly recommend it to everyone ,1
first of all nothing tastes exactly like sugar having said that however i give this product high marks because it tastes good and i do not detect any aftertaste or bitterness when i use it i made peach cobbler and it was excellent a simple blueberry conserve made with fresh berries ideal and maybe a little cinnamon and or amaretto liqueur is just marvelous with toast at breakfast or a pancake and is actually way better than sugary jam in my opinion it does not sweeten tea as well as it works in baked goods not sure why and if i put it in yoghurt it takes a couple of minutes to dissolve properly ideal does have a small amount of maltodextrin and sucralose maybe that is why it tastes just a little better and i prefer it overall to straight xylitol products not many stores carry it in my area but it is worth ordering online i am diabetic so this has worked very well for me this type of alcohol sugar product xylitol was approved by my diet counsellors at our local hospital educational unit ,1
this has become one of my favorite k cup coffees it has a great bold taste i will certainly be buying again ,1
ok so i do not normally use strong language but after receiving a free sample of lipton mango pineapple iced green tea mix i could not spit far enough sweetened with honey right read the fine print this is a cocktail of artificial and natural flavor stuff that should never be in a fine brew it leaves an after taste that just will not go away and to put it nicely well i can not put it nicely awful awful stuff this one does not deserve a rating ,0
i meant to buy this for my daughter but it is too spicy for little kids its taste is good for adult though usually the curry powder in the supermarket will have label showing it is hot or medium hot but this product has no such label ,1
very fast shipping and everything was as promised it is perfect for our daughter is wedding and the price was better than all other places ,1
absolutely the way to go if you are cutting refined sugar low glycemic index tastes like sugar great for diabetics ,1
this chips are perfect for a snack without having greasy fingers leftover all the flavors are great with my favorite being the vinegar and sea salt ,1
i enjoy the subtle delicate taste of blueberry in this white tea it has become my favorite i know it is better for my health than coffee and it leaves me feeling serene and cared for ,1
love the hot and sour soup,0

i will not go into detail on how amazing this cereal is because i feel the above comments say enough what i will enlighten the lovers of this cereal about is its current availability i wrote to general mills corp about this cereal and this is what a representative from their consumer services department came back with thank you for contacting general mills your comments are important to us we are committed to making a difference in the lives of our consumers feedback such as yours is important to the nature of our business the count chocula cereal is a seasonal product available in the fall please watch the store shelves this fall for the product to return the product has a long shelf life if you would like to stock up in the fall check the dates on the packages to see how long you will have to use the product for an extra special treat throughout the year we appreciate your loyalty and the time you took to contact us please be assured that we will share your thoughts with the appropriate individuals in summary if you are looking for this cereal to resurface keep your eyes on store shelves once the weather cools down and the leaves start to change colors ,1
i was really happy when i found this item for my son i have used suckers in the past to treat my son but the fact that i was allowing such trash to enter his body really wore on my mind when i found these organic suckers i was so excited amazon delivered these quickly and securely my son and i tried them when they arrived and to my surprise they tasted really good my son seems to enjoy them too not quite as much as the aregular suckers i suppose however the only thing i would have to say that is negative would be that these suckers are maybe a little too sweet yes an organic item that is sweeter than non organic it is only the sugar that is naturally found in the fruits used to make the suckers but they are sweet overall i would really recommend this to healthy minded moms as a treat for kiddos ,1
i had this for the first time two days ago it may take a tiny bit of getting used to but it is a wonderful cereal you do need to be a little careful though i wound up with some sort of seed maybe flax that was as hard as wood and incapable of being chewed that could have been a problem if i bit into it the wrong way cereal in general is not good for you it is not the worst thing you can eat but it is not really good i think this cereal is a rare exception and you can feel great about eating it with your favorite milk or yogurt i double the portion size add a cup of milk and it is a great meal and not too high in calories ,1
this is seriously the best mustard i have ever had i originally purchased this mustard from the v satttui winery and i had to find more you will not regret this purchase ,1
seriously my dog goes absolutely bats t crazy over these things her teeth are cleaner and her breath is nice and fresh highly recommended ,1
the taste of this tea is absolutely phenomenal i grew up in southern india hyderabad where tea flows like water and chai wallahs are omnipresent it was hard for me to appreciate the choices i have in the states as far as tea is concerned black tea specifically because none of the black tea i find here tastes good to me unless i turn it into chai by adding milk and spices but this tea does not need even a crystal of sugar because the combinations of cinnamon and sweet cloves they use make it naturally sweet and it smells heavenly too every time i go back to india i order a box to take with me the tea comes in different packages you can buy the large rectangular bags which come in shiny copper colored tins which are not value for money compared to these individually wrapped slightly smaller tea bags i seep two bags in piping hot water for three minutes to reach the strong taste i like keep sipping ,1
i saw this coffee at a great deal and thought i would try it so glad this is the dark roast which leaves a bit of aftertaste smooth and not bitter to me tastes like the coffee we get on our trips to new orleans and i had no idea that this brand tasted like this i usually get store brand and something special for the weekends these lb bags of were alittle over a pound at amazon warehouse deals which is not the regular amazon site chk it out ,1

received the chorizo in a timely manner it was well packaged the diameter of the sausage was much less than i imagined my son and i liked the taste the vendor seems very conscientious to please his customers ,1
i have not lived in brooklyn for over years but when i did these were a staple of girls weekends there is nothing quite like haribo frogs i have not ever seen them anywhere i have lived since although i am in detroit now and we have which is where i always got them in b klyn ,1
finally i have found the hot cocoa i was a bit concerned knowing this kind needed milk and not water but took the plunge anyway what an excellent use of calories this is not cocoa this is drinking chocolate this cocoa is the perfect balance of sweet milky chocolate with deep rich barely bitter dark chocolate you will never go back to inferior mass market envelopes of cocoa again why did not they have this stuff when i was a kid child abuse i have tried them all from godiva to land o lakes gourmet to swiss miss i will never go back to those again ,1
this is a greaat drink anytime of the year especially for those on a diet orfor children or grand children makes great popcycles too the fact that itcomes in a cannister either in a tube or small coffee cream type containermakes it easy to store and to prepare it comes in the usual kool aid flavors ,1
this is the best kept tea secret on the web i am accustomed to buying high quality loose tea from stash tea but davidson is bulk tea on amazon is my new favorite for i get what would have cost me from stash it is organic delicious with nutty and grassy flavors and can be brewed times please do not tell anyone about this lest davidson is realize what a ridiculous value this is and raise the price ,1
i remember buying ragu a few years ago and never buying it again but i could not remember why just look at the container its tomato sauce what could go wrong everything about it is wrong for me now that i tried it once more and i am writing a review to remind me later this contains sugar and sugar is same as poison for me the taste just makes me mad the container label says there is only of sugar per serving but when i eat it it feels like there is no tangy tomato flavor it feels like i am eating juice or jam or something too sweet not pasta sauce like i compared it with a can of del monte chunky garlic and herb sauce and del monte is so much better it contains high fructose syrup in place of sugar but i felt it was much more satisfying tastier less sweet and more tangy than ragu and its cheaper too did i miss to say del monte is chunky while ragu is not even when labelled chunky if you want to buy del monte sauce online with fast shipping try amazon is grocery site soap dot com ragu is america is worst tasting sauce not like advertised at all more like america is favorite tomato flavored jam syrup also double checked ingredient list on the bottle and it says sugar while amazon says corn syrup amazon should have said sugar and helped me save so star for amazon too ,0
a friend is research to find a good food for her diabetic cat revealed that the choices specifically in the ff classic are lower in carbs than most on the market her cat is diabetes resolved and she attributed it to the ff classic ca not beat the price through this seller and shipping arrangement ,1
i used to hate dark chocolate and well candy bars in general i came across this brand of candy bars while living in vermont the chocolate just melts in your mouth and all the flavors blend flawlessly anyone who has ever thought dark chocolate was bitter should try this line of candy bars to see what a good confectioner can do with dark chocolate i particularly like the blend of the crunchy almonds with the tart crisp fruit when you first bite into this candy bar you are only briefly aware of each distinctive ingredient as they compliment each other and blend so well together the added love poem which changes is a nice surprise makes a wonderful gift i would recommend this candy bar and brand to everyone ,1
switched to lid veal or venison about months ago for my shih tzu and my chow chow my shih tzu has severe allergies to most grains and to chicken which is in nearly all non lid dog food however she still threw up about once a week still a major improvement from every day i decided to go ahead and try the rice and lamb even though i have heard you should not give dogs grains and he stomache has been in great shape from both ends oh and no more an l gland issues either so i guess that rice as a grain works for some dogs anyway i was in love with n balance before now i feel like our household really can not live without thank you for making such great products ,1
i just love these my favorite of all of the goraw cookies who does not love chocolate ,1
stay away from the grove square products i ordered this because i would been so happy with the amazon subscribe and save service in the past and these were the only k cups available at the time i placed the order shame on amazon for making this the only brand available these are not true k cups with the filter inside etc they are basically instant coffee sealed in the k cup packaging many times when you put them in the machine the cup does not fill all the way i estimate i did not get a full cup out of of the k cups and had to start the process over with a new k cup wasting a lot of time and money the flavor of the coffee is also bad and has the exact taste you would expect from instant coffee ick to sum up save yourself some time and money if you want instant coffee flavor and lots of hassle these are for you if not get another brand of real k cups ,0
according to my taste buds this falls into the medium category good flavor smooth i like this for my day to day morning coffee this is the first cup i have to get my day started ,1
i liked the taste if this coffee it is very smooth and flavorful with no bitterness at all the one cup serving is also convenient do notice though that it is only useful if you have a particular type of one cup coffee machine,1
feeding an addiction to ginger honey tea and chocolate over the last years has lead to a severe overgrowth of candidias yeast throughout my system hence at present i have undertaken a serious change of diet to kill off as much as possible i purchased fresh miracle berries to help with the sweet cravings i am thanking my creator for such a berry it really works and ethan gardens is a fantastic vendor to do business with so helpful and quick and ready to accomodate i also purchased the tablets but of course the fresh berries were much more to the point i have also purchased seeds to grow and look forward to the good results this summer ,1
this milk tastes really good and keeps for a long time on the shelf i have tried all of the flavors but i like this one best the portion is just enough to satisfy and get nutrients ,1
great tasting with no aftertaste the only problem is that i paid for two bottles and only received one ,1
spent for real kona coffee and did not want the kona blend sold here the hawaiian roasters was disappointing tasted nothing like the kona we had everyday while honeymooning in maui not good,0
these are perfect for my big granddog who needs a pill every day he takes his pill gladly with these they came quickly and in perfect condition and this was the best price we found ,1

every year i brave the mist and the fog to pick wild huckleberries then comes the laborious chore of cleaning the pickings why bother when you can get such delicious wild huckleberries in syrup and jam form these have become my favorite gifts to give and receive ,1
my son loves this milk as a snack or in his lunch but buying the individual cartons can be expensive amazon offers the box price and delivers on a monthly basis it is great ,1
i find this to be a very good replacement for standard vanilla i love the flavor of using vanilla beans but can rarely afford them this is a fantastic way to get around the cost and it is so much easier to use i first used this in chocolate chip cookies that were taken to a party and they were gone in no time at all everyone loved the flavor i will recommend this product to anyone ,1
purchased these dates to enjoy right out of the pkg but alas they are too dry to eat except in recipes such as date nut bread very disappointed i hoped they would be as good as sunsweet is in a can but were not at all too bad i like the convenience of the foil pkts i would not buy these again big waste of money ,0
these are by far my favorite snack food they also happen to be one of the only lundberg rice chips that are completely vegan they have the perfect blend of spices and a great crunch without being too spicy the only problem i find is that they are very high in sodium ,1
this is very convenient and whenever i go out with my baby i always take packets with a bottle of water i am planning to travel months later and i will buy enough of these to take with me ,1
i eat chips almost every day and decided i wanted to find something that tastes as good but is lighter on unnecessary fat than regular types of chips i bought a case of popchips bbq these are satisfying and taste great they do not taste exactly like any full fat chip products i have had mainly because they are not greasy at all but they have a nice bbq potato chip flavor these are thick crunchy and light i first bought the oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch would probably be alright for a snack of the oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake but considering the same volume of regular chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what i was looking for i find the ounce bags to be perfect even eating all ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips this makes popchips very satisfying to me and i have bought many cases through amazon heads up unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through amazon causing me to cancel my subscribe save subscriptions popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce i love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it is hard to justify paying double for the same product the flavors are pretty straight forward but here is my thoughts original flavor tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease not my favorite flavor but good for what it is this flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip chedder cheddar quickly became tied with bbq for my favorite like bbq the cheddar flavor is very strong great chips salt pepper very strong pepper to enjoy these you have to really like pepper i like them but they are not a favorite sea salt vinegar i am not a fan of vinegar but strangely i enjoy this flavor they are indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor ,1
green tea really does make one feel good i am surprised at the subtle changes in my body that came with a regular diet of tea it does not taste good by itself and has a bit of a bitter taste but it tastes great with a bit of sweet n low or as iced tea you can make several cups of tea from one tea bag so you can make yourself at least a couple of nice mugs of tea and use just one bag a day though the second or third cups will require longer to steep overall a good tea with great antioxidants and cleansing properties ,1
love these bars they are easy to tote around and taste like real food they actually satisfy peanut butter chocolate cravings plus they are gluten free i have purchased these at different places they were on sale here and qualified for free shipping i got two boxes since they tend to go fast ,1
i love this product i buy sets every year as christmas presents for my tea loving friends and they really appreciate the beauty flavor and imagaination of flowering tea it is a great party favor as well thanks numi for creating such a cool product and doing all the good things you do ,1
my husband and i have been buying senseo coffe pods for about years recently i placed orders a few days apart for a total of packages of this coffee we love the coffee but the quality of some of the pods is disappointing so far we have opened packages of the first order inside of the packages were pods that were not fully sealed and the loose coffee had fallen out in the packages if we find more unsealed pods all of the remaining packages are going back to amazon ,1
we served these drinks at a birthday party and everyone loved them they were popular with adults and even notweens a hard to please age the taste is very refreshing and the carbonation is light not bitter quite delicious i would recommend them to anyone yum everyone at our party was asking where to buy them ,1
the coffee is pretty good but it does not fit a senseo well the pod is too big for the single pod holder and is too small for the double pod holder the result for me is i get either a too weak full cup or a too strong half cup i end up having to turn the machine off about through a full cup cycle to get it the way i like it granted it takes senseo pods to make a good full cup but at least i can make a good full cup without having to guess when to turn the cycle off i find it puzzling that these guys would not just make their pods in the right size for either a half cup or full cup the way a senseo was designed there may be other pod machines out there where these pods work well but that is not a senseo ,0
these bears are hard to find they are the mini ones that my kids love to use for their ice cream toppings individually packed they are the best gummy bears that i know of no wonder they are the biggest gummy bear manufacturer in the world based in germany it is not too sticky that it glues your teeth together the gummies are not too sweet just the right combination of flavors and taste just fyi each serving has calories carbo sugar and of protein a serving is about pieces of gummies ,1
i bought this thinking it would be better than all of those other proteins out there marketed to babies plus my son loves the veggie fruit pouches but he will not touch any of these chicken beef or bean with a pole and we have tried to offer them quite a few times i say try at your own risk but do not buy more than one or you may be wasting your money stick to fresh chicken ,0
a number of reviewers have complained about the price of this product stating that it is higher than the price at costco while that statement is true this product is a good deal when you are sending it to someone as a gift you have an amazon prime membership and the person you are sending the gift to does not live near a costco or have a costco membership when those conditions are met this is a great price performer and a welcome gift i was going to buy the product from costco and send it to a friend until i realized that shipping would cost more than the difference in price along with my time the cost of the box packing material etc i have sent this item to friends regularly they always enjoy it and appreciate the gift i appreciate the quality of the jelly belly product and saving on shipping compared to sending it myself ,1
i used one packet in a large cup and added hot water i thought this drink would be yellow but it ended up looking dark brown and i would compare it to rusty looking water i had never tried a lemon ginger drink before and did not entirely know what to expect i figured it would be like a strong lemon flavored tea instead i got rust colored and spicy hot cup of disgusting water i could taste the lemon but the ginger was incredibly strong and was quite honestly the nastiest thing i have ever drunk i forced myself to consume about half of the cup to give it an honest try but ended up pouring the rest down the sink and will never try again it also left my lips tingly as if i had just eaten a bunch of hot peppers i know everyone has different taste but i find it difficult to believe that some people actually like this stuff ,0
this coffee is surprisingly good i am no connoisseur but for the bucks you can not beat the quality enjoying some now recommended ,1

when i found out i was suffering from vitamin toxicity this was the only cereal brand i could find that was not fortified with the b vitamins now i only wish i could find a multi vitamin that did not have vitamin dropped one star because of the price but still less expensive than buying at whole foods or safeway ,1
bottles is dollars but,1
so i usually consider pasta to be pasta to be pasta it is usually all the same to me however when i tried this brand of pasta i noticed that it does taste better i can not describe how exactly but it does i thought maybe it was my imagination maybe knowing it is organic was influencing my judgment but my sister commented on it when i served it for her one day she wanted to know where i got it it tasted so good hmmm so while usually there is not much of a taste difference when it comes to noodles and pasta for this brand there is it is subtle but it is there when we moved from california i discovered they did not sell it in the stores here in ny so i was elated when i found amazon carries it elated over a simple pasta yes that is how good it is in comparison mmmmmm mmmmm ,1
this is a great product to try it is like hot chocolate with a mixture of chai tea and spices i highly recommend it ,1
i have taken to stocking gum at my desk but that can get expensive when you use the products at normal stores this tub lasts my office co workers a long time and the gum is big enough where one piece usually suffices just like all gums in this genre the flavor fades relatively quickly but this is the most economical way to purchase them one last note the product comes sealed around the rim of the bucket but it also comes sealed across the opening on the inside i liked that because it meant that the gum is fresh and not rock hard ,1
it like drinking a energy drink without the sugar cant wait till it ready to ship again it must be pretty popular becaus even green mountain coffe dont have any,1
my kids and i love this drink it is relatively healthy and my yr old chooses it over a soft drink which i think is great will say this though very disappointed with the shipping i ordered cases that came in separate boxes opened the smaller box first and did not open the one until today a bottle in each of the cases had somehow leaked one bottle was completely empty in the first case the other was about empty but will not use it because of this was a big mess too needs to be packaged better no packing peanuts or bubble wrap just the cases stacked on top of each other wish there was a way to let them know too anyway love the product just hope it arrives better next shipment ,1
i think this is suited best for those who usually do not enjoy coffee it kind of taste like a artificial syrup i do not even know if i am going to finish the bags ,0
iam glad i reviewed the nutritional label you got to be kidding its like hypertension high blood pressure untold additional physical ailments in a tin can this is outragous why ruin a perfect food with poison excessive salt sodium i cannot willnot buy this product ever ,0
i bought this product to occupy my mix she is an aggressive chewer but the product description led me to believe that this toy was quite tough when i received it i was a little disheartened when i saw that the tug was rubber rather than rope as it appears in the picture as she tends to get through rubber toys with very little effort nevertheless i decided to try it out she learned quickly that she could get treats out of it and it occupied her very well for almost an hour at that point i went to dig it out from under the bed and was dismayed to find that the rubber pull was already in pieces while the bottle still works and seems to keep her interested i feel like dog toys should have a more indestructible nature than this one does especially for eleven dollars ,0
i was very disapointed with this item it does not look like the photo shown in fact when it came i thought they had made a mistake the only good thing about this thing is it is indestructable make sure it is put away after it has been chewed on hitting your toes on this in the middle of the night might cause you to throw it across a room ,0
i have had to cut back on caffeine and diet soda in general so i was on a mission to find an alternative this tropical fruit tea fit all my needs good taste sugar free and caffeine free i use an extra bag or two and brew it a little longer and it tastes just like fruit punch the cold brew feature makes it so easy and convenient i highly recommend it to adults as well as kids ,1
i was buying this from my grocery store and spending an arm leg for it and then low and behold my favorite online store sells it this stuff is fantastic i use is for butter in my baked goods i also use it as a lotion and lip balm it feels great and smells wonderful i love the versatility of it i use a sugar cookie dough base recipe but i replace maple syrup sugar and wheat flour for white flour and make a healthy cookie muffin doughnut etc i can also add chocolate or ginger depending on what i am in the mood for anyways check it out and use it you will not be sorry that you did ,1
i love the peach tea flavor at the grocery store one snapple is nearly the same price as one mio i actually end up getting more out of the mio than a case of snapple simply because i can control how much i want to drink in one serving whereas sometimes i end up throwing half a snapple away i have not noticed any chemical taste or smell like some of the other reviews it is also great how this mio has no calories or sugar so i love it when i need a water replacement however i would not buy this product on amazon it is far less expensive in the store ,1
i like many of enjoy life is products but not this one tastes very off that is the best i can describe it i do not like things that taste like artificial fruit and this has that taste also we take everything into our chiropractor who uses applied kinesiology to test foods on us and while my children test fine for other enjoy life products they do not test well for this one so keep looking ,0
i find this coffee a little bit too mild for me perhaps others will like it fine i have not had any of the problems with coffee grounds that others have mentioned ok so my review was not looooong enough so i will add this last sentence for no real reason ,1
i make this in my miracle stainless steel rice cooker and it is superb really the best rice i have ever tasted ,1
in the great british trifecta of british powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar horlicks the most malty milo is medium chocolately and malty and ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately all are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just will not do all are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink the latter two with chocolate flavor as well i love all drinks but if you are drinking this for nostalgia is sake make sure you get the ovaltine from where ever your nostalgia springs from because ovaltine is made in different countries and they all taste a little different for me ovaltine is the most chocolately of all and a great comfort drink for cold nights i like it more than simply hot chocolate because it is not as sweet and has a slight malty flavor to it best of all you can control the taste because you can adjust the amounts of sugar and ovaltine you add ,1
great tasting chai easy to desolve it in hot water adds zing to coffee too i do not like cloves or allspice and thankfully can not taste any in this yummy brew ,1

my daughter is lactose intolerant and i ordered these cookies for her unfortunately they are not as good as oreo is which is what the other reviewer said but since my daughter loves them and they are dark chocolate that is good enough for me ,1
we use in our homemade frappes i originally bought the variety pack to see which ones i would like best i thought i would like the chocolate best but i liked the irish cream and my husband likes the vanilla the best part is that it is made with splenda instead of aspartame ,1
black cherry switch is juice a mixture of juices actually but more on that later combined with filtered sparkling water it has no sugar added or corn syrup no artificial colors or preservatives these are all positive attributes i think the concept of combining fruit juice and carbonation in a small shot serving ounces in a slim can is just fine my problem with black cherry switch in particular the only flavor i have tried is that cherry juice is listed fourth out of four juices this beverage contains the other three are apple grape and acerola juices as a result the cherry flavor ends up battling and getting trounced by these other flavors the end result was for me inadequate cherry flavor will i run out to buy more black cherry switch no even though the beverage was refreshing the cherry flavor was too muddled by other juices and too low in the ingredients list to give me the punch of black cherry flavor that i expected and wanted would i buy more black cherry switch if it had a more distinct cherry taste yes it is highly likely that i would buy it at least occasionally ,0
i drink this tea nearly every day sometimes twice and really like the flavor with the health benefits of green tea and the convenience of the keurig i drink more of it now than i used to when i did the wait brew wait brew thing with old fashioned tea i highly recommend it ,1
the good the test of any dog treat is how much my dog likes them after all they are treats for him he loves these biscuits in fact i usually give him a dog supplement with each treat and he refuses to eat his supplement until after each biscuit crumb is gone i also like the size of the large biscuits my lab needs to actually chew these can not gulp them in one bite the so so the ingredients are pretty standard i home feed my dog so i do pay attention to ingredients still treats are treats and as such the ingredients in these once per day treats are acceptable to me the amazon com price for the large biscuits is per pound way cheaper than some of the other things marketed as teeth cleansing but still per pound even with free shipping is a little high i checked and these are not offered as subscription items which would knock off of the price overall summary i give this product stars marking down just slightly for price ingredients that said i am placing my order now ,1
these have a made from scratch flavor and texture very good quality chocolate i recommend cutting them in squares and placing in a covered container overnight they taste much better the next day as with many baked goods i will buy again for sure ,1

i had these sent to my mom who lives an another state and they were just beautiful arrived in buds just like they advertised and lasted a long time she was just overjoyed withe arrangement,1
i am glad i gave this product a second chance previously packages i ordered had defective tea bags so the leaves would be in the bottom of the pitcher but so far so good with this case ,1
i recently had to stop drinking caffeinated beverages because they were making me jittery my favorite reasonably priced green tea was yamamotoyama green tea i loved that tea because it tasted clean and refreshing and it had a great color to it i kept searching around for a decaf option and found this on sale at the grocery store i did not like this tea at first since it was different the color is certainly not as pleasing to the eye it is not such a bright green however it has really grown on me it has a hint of lemon grass too which took some getting used to however now i drink it all day long at the office and the best thing is this tea does not bother my acid reflux or give me heartburn sometimes teas can also make me feel a little nauseated sometimes however this one is gentle on my stomach as well a great product ,1
my first pod coffeemaker was a senseo now relegated to the garage limited coffee options weak tasting coffee bought the keurig based on amazon reviews and liked it from the first now i love it because i found a dark deeply satisfying roast that makes my day full on coffeehouse flavor with no bitter aftertaste it is one of three featured varieties in our office timothy is breakfast blend coffee people black tiger and tully is italian roast we have all three on subscription and they are a hit with both staff and client partners btw my personal choice is almost always this one ,1
great variety and comes in a package that does not crush during delivery i gave it it is own shelf in my pantry no fuss not mess and convenient to get to delivery was quick and when you add it up i believe i am saving money over the grocery store,1

this buttery salt tastes just like what you find in the theaters however be careful of the spout it pours very fast it would be better to buy a salt shaker for a more even controlled cover ,1

this is quickly becoming our favorite green tea almost as soon as i have enjoyed drinking a large mug i make another unlike other decaf greens we have tried my wife does not ask for peppermint leaves or hibiscus blossoms or other natural flavorings in hers to offset unpleasantness i have been searching for years for an unflavored decaf green with a good leaf and mouth feel this is it it is organic and non chemically processed to boot according to the tea company is site our organic decaffeinated teas utilize a carbon dioxide rinse process to remove the caffeine a process we feel leaves more of the tea flavor and leaf structure intact this process is also usda approved for certified organic tea caffeine free these teas maintain much of the body and character of their caffeinated counterparts and can be enjoyed all day i certainly agree and gratefully tip my cup to davidson is for making this healthy tea as well as other loose decaf and regular teas available to all i also appreciate amazon is subscribe save program which is convenient economical and user friendly this is a tea i will be reordering ahead of schedule ,1

my husband and i love these compleat dinners i chose the turkey version because it is relatively low in fat and calories i love the second prep time although i usually add another seconds to make sure it is really hot it you are in a real hurry and want a tasty meal in seconds these dinners are your choice we have also tried several of the other flavors some of which measure up and some of which do not but they are all at least acceptable and you can not beat the convenience especially the fact that they are shelf stable and do not need refrigeration or freezing ,1

i was a little worried about buying a bonsai tree sight unseen especially since it was to be a christmas gift for a very good friend needless worry the bonsai tree was perfect its branches were a deep green it was planted in a black ceramic bonsai dish and included a rock it had been packaged very well so that the soil was still damp and no branches injured during transport the company included a sheet of very helpful instructions and a free bottle of liquid fertilizer it is always nice to do business with a company that cares about its products and this company certainly does ,1
this is a really good tea i am drinking it during my pregnancy to tone the uterus very good taste ,1
you have adopted the word balance on your product this word is generally used for a true balance of decaf and regular coffee this misleads people purposely to think that they are using a coffee that is a mix of both i have always mixed the two and was happy to see that you have a balance and believed that it truly was such that was quite a disappointment ,0
we have been hooked on this chili for a few years now and it recently became unavailable at our local grocery store so we are frantically looking for another place that might have it we typically add a half pound of cooked hamburger and then throw it in a bowl top it with some sour cream and cheese and use corn chips usually fritos to dip in the soup sooooo goood ,1
i have used sweeteners for as many years as i can remember being in a family with diabetes i can well remember my aunt stockpiling sweeteners that were available then because she knew she needed to always have it available guess it stuck with me now i have to say that taste is most important to me so i was prepared to be unsatisfied if it did not taste good actually the taste was somewhat surprising it was very mild so much so that i did not think of its being sweet however i did like it in tea which is my normal morning drink now the only thing that would prevent my using this product because of its being natural is cost we do not yet know the cost but since the product comes individually packed in a special foiled container and since there is already a splenda product my ranking is based upon anticipating that this product will cost more than other sweetners as many natural and low calorie products do which is sad but true in the past for a regular cup of tea i would use half a package of sweetner so the mild flavor worked for me if somebody really likes lots of a sugar taste one package would probably not work for them i would recommend it with my noted concerns gabixlerreviews,1
the cheese tastes wonderful once you try this cheese you will think kraft tastes so artificial i love that i can let my daughter and son eat mac and cheese when they want it is healthy and nutritious i eat the leftovers when there are some ,1

i really like the oil coconut oil has the good oils in it it is being touted by researchers as a good oil to off set alzheimers i use it on my skin as well ,1
this granola is super tasty and also healthy the ingredients are pure and simple there are no surprises when you read the label i have not tried the other flavors that love grown makes but this sweet cranberry pecan is to die for it is got a cinnamon and pecan taste and the dried cranberries give it a chewy texture when you get one in your bite it is not overly sweet just about the perfect amount of sweetness for my taste to the reviewer who gave this product star and said it was not clustered sounds like your bag got smashed that is probably the fault of whoever handled it either during storage packing or shipping and it is not the fault of the manufacturer this stuff is clustered crunchy and delicious the only problem is that it is addictive you might find yourself wishing you had ordered more good job love crunch i will be trying some of the other flavors next ,1
my order was messed up i ordered rye and got rye and other kind i wrote to seller explained problem and asked for overnight shippment so we could cook my grandma is favorite cereal for her big day with the family sharing all of grandma is favorite foods from her lifetime age the product did not arrive by the event planned however it was shipped and received the next day with the correct contents when i called to returned unordered items i was told to keep them and enjoy the seller really tried their best i believe to correct the order in time for my needs however it fell one day short overall grandma got to eat her rye cereal we did not get too except for a spoon full and i will give the seller a star because accidents do happen and i truly do not believe the error was intentional ,1
a couple of the k cups were open and had to be thrown out coffee was spilled over the remaining cups which i had to wash and dry ,0
for what it is worth the better than bouillon organic mushroom base has different ingredients as compared with the non organic version i found this item for about at our small local health food store in brunswick maine the ingredients are mushrooms salt cane sugar maltodextrin natural flavors dried onion soybean oil dried garlic and natural butter flavor i have not tried it yet but i will give you an update after i use it and amend the star rating as needed each jar has servings and makes quarts of broth a tsp serving has mg of sodium and just calories ,1
love wellness canned food i have done a lot of pet food research and i have come down to wellness canned grain free non core varieties only being the best it is grade a food that is actually made in the usa you would be surprised how hard this is to find e g weruva is made in thailand i only wish they did not use bpa in their cans my cats loved the turkey flavor for a very long time however as with all foods they got sick of it eventually so now i rotate between turkey salmon chicken herring and chicken and beef ,1
i really wanted to like this tea because it is full of antioxidants i was hoping for a fruity flavor but instead it tastes just like cough syrup i do not have good memories of cough syrup as a child so because the flavor reminds me so much of yucky cough medicine i can not drink it i tried to drink it anyways thinking that the benefits of a tea filled with anti oxidants outweigh the flavor but i just could not do it well that is just my cents if anyone else has tried this and agrees with me let me know ,0
so beware its instant coffee not real coffee i was expecting a dark roast sort of brew with a hint of vanilla my mistake for not reading others reviews that said it is not bad its is instant though so think those machines at the gas station that you pick your flavor from that is what it is i would but again but for different reasons not a morning pick me up its also loaded with sugar and fat so dieters beware ,1
my grocery store stopped carrying this it is a great soup easily heated in the microwave and very tasty and satisfying a big part of my successful weight loss program this past year too delighted to get it from amazon a little cheaper and in quantity ,1
while i am not usually one to put a lot of stock in differences in shampoos i have to give this one credit it cleans very well and actually smells pretty good it is not some crazy fruit smell of strawberries or the like but a nice mint while that is not terribly manly itself it is better than most it is a lighter feeling shampoo that does not seem to weigh hair down and rinses away well ,1
simply put i cannot eat any other graham crackers but these they are so good and organic which is a plus ,1

as stated above im a huge alice in wonderland fan so i decided to give this a try im not really a tea person but this tea isnt very strong and surprised me with how nice it was i would def recommend this to anyone who is considering this item the only issue i had with this product was that the tea i like is on the bottom which makes it difficult because i had to take all the top ones off before i could get to it that and the lid for the clear package is not very sturdy it slides off ,1
my first box of stash decaf green tea arrived about mins ago and i am sitting here enjoying my very first cup this is a really good cup of decaf green tea i used water that had not quite starting boiling so as not to burn the tender tea steeped it for mins and added some ambrosia raw unfiltered honey i bought both products via amazon is subscribe and save so i saved an additional few dollars off their already low price any subscribe and save purchase comes with free shipping even if the total order is less than amazing savings and fantastic taste sorry if i seem like an advertisement but i am really excited tea is sooo expensive in the grocery store so i saved a bundle and i am drinking some of the best decaf green tea i have had in a while extremely smooth with no bitter after taste ,1
i love the bbq ones glad i ordered the variety pack but i think bbq won over all of them but they all are good,1
i have been accused of going over board on some things and my k cup obsession has been no different i have tried almost every bold k cup on the market really my kitchen is full of those little boxes many of them are very good and some like timothy is rainforest espresso are excellent still for day to day drinking i always go back to this blend i find it to be smooth and satisfying i use the second to smallest setting on my keurig oz and i usually enjoy three to four cups in the morning i never reuse a k cup but if it works for some people fine if i want more or a cup later in the day i switch to the decaf version also very good i miss my newman is own so much when i travel that i have started packing a keurig with me so i can enjoy this coffee on the road this one is perfect for me ,1
i have been drinking two leaves and a bud rooisbos tea nearly every day for the past six months it is refreshing with a mild flavor and no caffeine so i bring an iced quart to work and enjoy it all day long it mixes well with other herbal teas as well i often mix in a teaspoon or two of two leaves and a bud is alpine tea for variety and a hint of natural sweetness as an added benefit i find that the tea helps keep my rosacea and adult acne from flaring up when i drink it my skin is much clearer and i have less redness and when i do not drink it for a couple of days the redness returns i have even used a second steeping as a post wash rinse it feels good and seems to help ,1
love all of pamela is products even the non gf eaters love things made with pamela is easy to use tastes good highly recommend to someone looking for an easy gf alternative to the traditional bisquick or jiffy mixes,1
i am now enjoying my first cup of this tea the postal carrier delivered my box today the top scent flavor is blackberry yes it is tart but wild blackberries are rather tart here in texas your favorite sweetening agent sugar splenda whatever you like can fix that just as it does with the fresh berries granted i do not like a very sweet tea as many do in the south and southwest but i do not like my tea regular or herbal unsweetened either vanilla is the second scent flavor oh the scent and taste of home baked cookies though vanilla is the second scent flavor it does overtake the blackberry sometimes as a pleasant surprise the box listed hibiscus and other flavors in the tea as well they are not as dominant of course as the berry and vanilla i barely taste them however people with certain allergies might still need to take care this is a good tea to enjoy when taking a break in the afternoon when people often need a little something to go on until dinner but do not want caffeine i requested this through vine and i would definitely consider buying more ,1
this arrived with all packages containing drops that had melted into one large clump i have had the hershey is drops before and like them very much however unless packaging shipping is changed i do not recommend that anyone buy this thru amazon ,0
after testing all kinds of lavazza illy somatra starbucks yammenese and many other coffee beans i settled on using ethiopian coffee beans for both espresso and french press i use trader is joe organic ethiopian which is roasted to the dark side it is velvety and tasty i tried larry is beans because of medium roasting and the one year expiration date guess what i found it is even better than trader is joe less burn after taste and and very velvety it is also organic ethiopian and costs the same as trader is joe beans i subscribed to this coffee beans with amazon until later notice no more looking or testing coffee beans ,1
my daughter has become a picky eater the last few weeks on anything with vegetables so i was pleased when she loved this it is green and smooth stage food she is been eating it at room temperature but it can be stored in the fridge for later it does warn about the choking hazard of the cap but even so i find this packaging very convenient it squeezes like toothpaste and can be closed up just the same i have found this easier than getting food out of baby jars the package is portable in a baby bag at a year my daughter eats the whole package at one sitting but for a smaller child you will use less she seems to be trying to figure out this new source of baby food after being used to the jars just be careful your child does not squeeze the bag or you will probably have too much come out at once so for this mom i am happy to see something good for my child that she likes to eat ,1
i purchased a oz box of whitman is chocolates on sale for at a popular and well known national drug store chain although the use best before freshness date stamp was conveniently missing on the side of the box it did contain the words best before nonetheless the chocolates were very fresh and desirable in appearance the box is made of high quality cardboard covered with sturdy brightly colored yellow paper the interior contains sectional trays that house each chocolate in a dark chocolate paper cup this was an impulse purchase because i was being a bit nostalgic about the brightly colored yellow box with the signature whitman is sampler design these chocolates simply do not taste good there was not one piece of chocolate in the box that was pleasant to consume this is the time i have had this happen but childhood memories keep me coming back not anymore i am dissappointed that the chocolates are no longer of the same high quality they once were when i was a child the box notes that the chocolates contain nuts almonds pecans cashews peanuts and walnuts but the nuts were so crushed that they were unrecognizable both by sight and taste the chocolates contain a great deal of salt salt sodium bensoate sodium metabisufite and potassium sorbate truth in labeling they also contain a large number of artificial sugars and ingredients e g sorbital vanillin articial flavor preservatives fd c red sulfur dioxide gum arabic and mono and diglycerides etc do not waste your money buy a brand that contains less than ingredients i rate these chocolates for consumption flavor and taste i rate these chocolates for packaging appearance and appeal perhaps the manufacturers may want to consider spending less on packaging and more on the actual product ,0
i would occasionally treat myself by purchasing vanilla smoothies from my employer is cafeteria at a cost of per serving since this treat was a bit expensive i researched to determine if i could purchase a product that would produce the same reward i read the reviews of the other buyers of this product and made the investment it turned out to be just as good as the cafeteria and it is quite easy to make instead of paying per oz serving it only costs approximately if you want a smoothie that is different than vanilla just add fresh or frozen fruit if you are contemplating about whether you should purchase i would recommend to do so ,1
pamela is flour pancake mix is the best we have ever encountered we use it for everything we have never tasted such wonderful pancakes we think everyone should use it the price is excellent at amazon com as pamela is ultimate baking and pancake mix bags pack of,1
not as well as morton is or especially not as well as flavacol but it does work this is a fairly versatile salt that can be used for any number of things notjust popcorn or nuts i mean serious who buys nut salt right thats what makesthis somewhat of a disappointment from a revered company like diamond crystal causeimo their kosher salt and sugar products are the best in the business ,1
i have been fortunate to consistently drink this water since the release of it at the november retreat and since my life has changed dramatically as somebody who is well aware of the importance of water and drinks upwards to gallons a day when i am training this water puts the life back into my body and allows me to push it to new levels the graphics on it are exceptional and when i am drinking it out in public i always get asked what is trivedi water and i am never short of energy to explain it thanks mr trivedi for your hardwork and efforts in all that you do i truly believe in the power of his energy and if you are interested in this water then check out for more of mr trivedi ,1
i have tried quite a few k cup brands over the past few years and tully is coffee house collection really has the best dark roast blends out of them all when i first purchased this variety pack in it came with french roast italian roast kona blend and house blend now breakfast blend is substituted for kona blend and it is still good i really do not know what the other reviewers were thinking when they gave this product a one star rating due to the lack of kona blend get over yourselves and enjoy the breakfast blend now that amazon has changed the product image you can not blame amazon for false advertising so all your one star no kona reviews are now obsolete serves you right be happy with the inclusion of breakfast blend and learn to love it i certainly do ,1
coffee people kona blend island style has been my favorite prepackaged coffee for my keurig fog chaser may come in a close second i started on this one as the kona has not been available for awhile now the fog chaser is a medium bodied blend that does well any time of the day i like it iced also it is smooth with earth and cedar notes not sweet but not bitter a nice balance do not be fooled by the plastic bags with the air seals on them no coffee no matter if it is whole bean refrigerated or in fancy packaging will retain the same flavor profile it had in the first weeks after it is roasted coffee should be drunk in about days after it is roasted and for about another weeks the majority of flavor in coffee comes from it is aromatics and they are gone in a relatively short period of time when i have time i buy green coffee beans roast them in my air pop popcorn poppers wait days grind as needed and drink it all in the next weeks tmalst these will not go bad if you leave the bag open on a counter ,1
maybe it is just me but i didnt care for this lamb curry i have had butter curry chicken and briyani and they are all good this tastes kind of weird to me and i am a lamb person if anyone could share an alternative recipe i would greatly appreciate itupdate i just tried this again with additional ingredients and this time it tasted much better i used some italian herb and kosher salt to marinate the lamb for a night and then added some onion to the pot and let it cook for an hour it tasted awesome fyi i also used imported lamb from new zealand this time not sure if that played a part in the difference in taste would appreciate it if anyone can share his her recipe,1

this item is a gyp and the seller produces false advertising i received this item today and its horrible i paid for this the tins of tea appear larger in the add this set will make about cups of tea for the packaging is not the same and it is not a gift set basically i got tiny tins of tea in a plain brown box and i did not get the tea strainer as promised i was supposed to get a nice flat style green box that looks like a gift box this thing looks like it was packaged by ups or fedex the free gift wrapping was a piece of red ribbon tied around a cardboard box how can i give this as a gift how can i call this a gift i could have gotten a set locally that was twice as nice for about more fool me once when i tried to contact the seller i got their answering machine eventhough it was during business hours and the mailbox was full so i could not leave a message do not do business with these people maybe they are fine throughout the rest of the year but when its christmas and when the going gets tough they get going right out the door close shop take the phone off the hook lock the doors etc ,0

i have always loved poppycock that wonderful concoction of popcorn drizzled in chocolate or caramel with clumps of peanuts or pecans or cashews i can eat a whole bag by myself unfortunately it is not light in calories or fat so imagine my surprise when i saw the snackwell fudge drizzled caramel popcorn on amazon a ounce bag has only calories that is a snack after my own heart i tried the chocolate drizzle thinking it would not be anywhere near as good as the poppycock but i was wrong one box contains individual bags the portions are just enough to satisfy your craving for something sweet but not too much that you feel guilty for overeating as i seem to have a problem with portion size it is nice to have individual bags that control the portion for me i felt like i had had a wonderful sugary snack without all the guilt the taste was wonderful i enjoyed every bite i am so glad i can now have chocolate covered caramel popcorn without the guilt the snackwell also comes in white fudge drizzle which i will also purchase this is a great snack if you are watching your weight and even if you are not i highly recommend this product to everyone ,1
they taste delicious but they could have used safer ingredients as a runner i feel like they slowed me down ,1
i mix three spoons of this in with my very picky borzoi is dry food every morning and evening and she actually eats the entire bowl hallelujah it is so hard to get my dog to eat i feed the dry version of this food and my other dog an akita loves it but my borzoi needs the wet to tempt her so i recommend this product to anyone who has a picky dog you do not need a ton of it just a few spoons and wa la your dog will eat ,1

i dont usually eat oatmeal cookies but these were very soft and delicious my kids even liked them and they are very picky,1

my mini poodle loves these greenies his groomer also uses them and we just went to a vet who was also familiar with them all dogs seem to love these toothbrushes highly recommend them ,1
for those that follow my reviews you know i have many dogs so i just had to try out this product it was so funny the day i received it i was surrounded with furry friends incase you do not know dogs can smell just about anything and they knew something was in my hands that they were going to like the container reminds me of roll on deodorant i know that sounds gross but nevertheless it did it is made where the dogs lick the top of it to receive their treat okay now all i had to do was let the dogs lick it and believe me they were ready they piled around me and all took their turns it was so cute now did they come back for more you bet they did each seeing who could get their tongue on it first i could tell to them it was a tasty treat and for me it was a time to interact with my animals and show them love you can not just let them play piggly wiggly and lick it all in one day because they would believe me you have to allow only so many licks i liked this product and so did my dogs and plan to purchase it for them dog biscuits are of course a lot easier you just throw them and they catch but this is a special treat that allows you time with your animal nice product ,1
the product is delicious and was delivered in a timely manner at an excellent price ,1
i read a really bad review of this but i am trying all the gopicnic meals so i tried it anyway there were more bad items than good in this unfortunately the salmon was like a weird tasting overly fishy lumpy soup gross and i love salmon in many shapes and forms i could not finish it and gave the majority to my dog since that is the main value of the meal protein i found this gopicnic meal to be of no value to me anyway the crackers were excellent same ones as in a few other meals the edamame was okay but bland google the dangers of eating soybean for women made me wary of eating this and the dry fruit mix was rancid i double checked the expiration date to make sure i did not get a bad lot but it does not expire for several months i am writing amazon for a refund after my review it is too bad i enjoyed the majority of the meals ,0
these bars are pretty darned good which is to say better than i thought they would be and better than my first impression first impression upon opening a bar was um they look dark and gritty and not too tasty and ok they are are dark and a little gritty then again they are tasty too they enough to take the hunger away and i like the fact that they are organic a big plus overall i would buy them again much better tasting than a lot of the fiber bars you can find these actually have fruit taste to them and just enough to satisfy you until the next meal ,1
all of my children love this book my first grader got it for christmas and loves to read the rhymes she is proud that she can do it herself each month her teacher works on a month from the book with the class not that she reads independently yet my girls especially enjoy reading the month they were born and singing going once going twice going chicken soup with rice this book is a classic that i remember from my childhood i highly recommend it i just wish the book was a larger size it tends to get lost in the bookshelf among regular sized books ,1
quality meaty product keeps well over time and my twin poodles love them great price as well ,1
when it does come down to my mornings i always do enjoy a good cup of coffee to start my days off right but i have chosen to drink more ground coffee than instant these days but it has also been much harder finding the right kind of great tasting cup and that does definitely come well with maxwell house and the simple original roast blend the taste is definitely simple and not too string for most new coffee drinkers but elequent enough to get your mornings off to a great start with each and every savory cup while there are not many great brands of coffee that have shown that test of time maxwell house has been one that has not lost its shine i absolutely recommend this brand each and every time price b taste b overall b ,1
oh wow i can not say enough about this coffee it is the kind that sits on your tongue and makes your whole mouth happy i will order this over and over again the flavor is smoothe and delicious stars for me and if you knew me i do not give stars ,1
i started buying this in my quest to find a good value oriented everyday olive oil for cooking and have recently converted to a subscription delivery after replenishing a couple of times this olive oil is great for cooking and emulsions but it is a neutral flavor and not as crisp as fresh press but having said that i will point out that i am still buying this olive oil ,1
i have purchased a variety of dop tomatoes in the past typically i been disappointed i usually find that california products taste markedly better the dop tomatoes i have tried previously turned out to be mealy and tinny tasting these tomatoes on the other hand had a bright taste and a balance of sweetness and acidity that made a very good marinara i have not used up this shipment so i do not know if every can is as good as this lot but if so these strianese tomatoes some garlic a couple table spoons of olive oil a pinch of crushed red pepper salt and pepper are all that is necessary for happiness ,1
i moved to the us from the uk over years ago and lipton is tea was a huge let down i have managed to find reasonable black tea at asian food stores or in the specialty aisle at big supermarkets but nothing compares with yorkshire gold i grew up very close to harrogate so it is always a nostalgic moment when i reach into the box to grab a bag and see images of the yorkshire countryside ,1
i just started my daughter on this because of it is special healing powers my daughter has a type of brain cancer it is doing well so far it tastes great kind of like apple juice ,1
twinings lady grey has long been my favorite in the earl grey family of teas lighter with more citrus and floral tones it is great when you want the taste of earl grey but not as much heaviness the pack is a good price so definitely to be recommended a great loose leaf tea for tea parties too ,1
our dog hurt her neck and had to take pain pills a day so these were a godsend she does think they are treats and whined for more so i had to hide them so she could rest and get her mind off of them these are apiece so you can price them and buy larger quantities on here if you need them for everyday use i am relieved that there is such a product that dogs like so they can take their pills and capsules highly recommend these ,1
the product arrived just at the right time the label was confusing since it read oz when it was really half gallon ,1
this is the best way to administer medications to your cat and the price was the best around,1
nice flavor good addition to a vegetarian and or vegan diet good in beans soups and stews will definitely buy again highly recommend ,1
our deployed troops got these peanuts sent by the packages from home group in their care packages makes for good fill in the nooks and crannies and good eating ,1

of all the different coffees my wife and i have tried for our keurig this is the best we both like our coffee strong almost always brewing the smaller cup this is strong without being harsh goes down smoothly extra bold dark diamond also by green mountain is stronger and i have brewed the larger cup for it but it is harsh ,1
nutrageous bars are the best candy bar ever the secret is in the nuts they truly are loaded up with peanuts not peanuts chopped to a paste but real actual nuts that and the combination of chocolate and peanut butter is to die for the problem is you cannot find nutrageous anywhere anymore so glad to find them here ,1
have bought this vanilla from amazon for a number of years now i keep needing to buy new packs when the bottles disappear around people who taste this vanilla or anything made with it everyone raves about it i hope amazon continues to sell this product as i really do not want to use any other kind ,1
the shipment came though quickly and smoothly the product is what i expected and had ordered,1

my kitty really loves this product it is a little hard to find in stock in town so this was perfect i have a months supply for him ,1
for a quick carbohydrate side dish it is hard to beat these light weight dehydrated potatoes they are not the equivalent of fresh mashed but they come closer than most similar products for me the seasoning is right and they have good texture when prepared as instructed incidentally i heat two cups of water in the microwave and pour it into the potatoes in a bowl whip for a minute or so with a fork and they are ready ,1
this is one of the best flavored teas i have ever had the mango is just there without being overbearing yet you know its been flavored and since it is white tea you know it is good for you ,1
i will admit i was skeptical since this tea was sold as a at a pretty cheap price could not possibly be of good quality if they are going to sell bulk for cheap right especially since i was looking for an alternative to lupicia is apple black tea which i love but it gets costly just opening the box and smelling the apple scent was convincing enough the brewed tea has a strong but not overpowering ceylon taste with a slight sweetness of apple i can imagine if i mixed some sugar and refrigerated this it would make a really delicious iced tea too if you like apple black tea i highly recommend this one ,1
these are excellent tasting olives they came in one huge bag that i opened and stored in large glass containers and popped in the fridge i do not know how long they will stay fresh because they came with a small amount of liquid but at the rate they are eaten that should not matter ,1
loved this product for us who love peanut butter but not all the fat i add this to my smoothies in the morning ,1
these are probably one of my favorite snacks they do not sell them in my town so i have to stock up i actually think they are better than potato chips but i have never been a greasy chip fan ,1
there was a mixup in our order after calling the company we found out it was an honest mistake we were told to keep the product and were refunded our money the same day any company that stands behind what they sell is a in my book and will not hesitate to do business with them in the future ,1
i took cooking classes in thailand and have tried just about every panang curry paste sold in the united states if i do not have time to make my own curry paste this is my go to product it stores well for at least months in the fridge after opening and tastes great plus it does not have msg like some of the other canned curry pastes out there give it a try ,1
i have cats mandy corny and they love treats anytime i give them some they really went crazy over these new ones the past two days when i have had these in my hands i am the most important person in the world to them they love these treats i like the fact that these apparently tasty treats are also nutritious and help remove tartar my cats are sold they want more of these and they will get some more i have the bag on the desk as i am writing this and from the sound of them they know it gotta go the kittens await,1
these crackers are so tasty and crunchy hard to find in the store and the price is better on amanzon anyway glad i can get them here ,1
i think that is the only way to describe this coffee bitter i do not use creamer or sugar in my coffee but with this one i have to add something to offset the bitter taste ,0
this cashew chicken kit has very good flavor and is easy to make it does not include enough rice for my taste so i add another half cup before cooking it makes enough food for two adults ,1
i have been eating these bars for several years now there are no artficial ingredients and they are equal to eating two whole pears excellent for on the go travel they are wheat dairy nut and gluten free my kids take them and eat them before ball games and lunch darla,1
love this green tea supplement it is hard to find a green tea supplement that is decaffinated and yet also has a high egcg count per capsule this supplement has it thanks ,1
this is a great product there is no grain or fillers in this there is also no corn which is rare most cats are actually allergic to corn this is one of the best ones on the market right now ,1
i do not like the smell of cat food this says it is people food for cats and it looks just like ground up fish with alot of juice the cans are the little cans same size as the fancy feast cans the real testament is from my cat she is oh so particular even turning down many types of fancy feast and other things this petite cuisine however she is madly in love with it she starts as soon as we get up about she prances all around the kitchen meowing for her petite cuisine once she has eaten we do not see her for the rest of the day she goes off to sleep this is the first food in her life that she has felt compelled to make a fuss for i think it has to be a winner ,1
i got this on the recommendation of dr oz for relief of mild arthritis in my wrists and knuckles i drink oz of reconstituted juice every evening and it tastes sweet and tart at the same time but mildly so all i know is i do not have any arthritis pain anymore ,1
purchased this soup because the bear creek brand which i love almost tripled their price shore lunch was a good substitute and a great value ,1
these individually sealed packs come with coffee tea creamer and sugar all pre mixed and sealed in a single bag the bags themselves are far larger than any tea bag and they do not have a string with tag attached for a traveller like myself this product is super convenient since there is both tea and coffee being brewed from a single pouch the taste is somewhat of an acquired one should i have coffee or should i have tea well no need to agonize over this dilemma because you are having both i for one is getting quite accustomed to it high tea any one cheers ,1
coconut oil has many many uses this nutiva product is great price is best i have found anywhere for its quality size of jar perfect to give to someone you want to introduce its benefits to i love coconut oil look it up on internet for extensive uses suggestions benefits ,1

these scones are amazing and so easy to make just add heavy cream to the mix and in minutes you have the most delicious scones you are ever tasted to make it less fatty i put half heavy cream and half half and half and it does not make much of a difference ,1
like everyone i read reviews on i was trying to satisfy my crf cat as soon as i got the package in the mail i opened a can for her dinner and she did not want any part of it i was so sad and discouraged i was hoping this was the ticket so i threw that can away after trying a couple more times weeks later i decided to give it another shot she ate it now it is all she eats not sure what the hold up was but she eats it now i have been on this streak for weeks now and hope it stays i gave stars after coaxing she now eats it and only likes it there us no absolute love in it i also did what others suggested which was the vita gravy she simply licked all the gravy parts and not the food tricky cats so i then mixed it all together and would not touch so good luck others just have to try a few times ,1
this is my favorite hot sauce hands down i can not compare it to red hot or tabasco because to me it has an entirely different flavor because it is habanero it is spicy but delicious however i would not recommend it to someone who does not like spicy food even some people i know that like spicy food could not take too much of this i put it on eggs mac cheese and of course mexican food i do not like as the other reviewer said that it has preservatives but it is still delicious ca not get enough ,1
i received the real cinnamon today it is really great it has a sweet aroma and a noticeably better and milder flavor than the cassia variety i ordered this variety for health reasons although i will use it in cooking as well cinnamon is known to have therapeutic properties and can act as an anti inflammatory my acupuncturist has recommended that i take tsp x is a day withhoney i am taking it with agave nectar i have read that this variety of cinnamon true cinnamon is much safer to take for these purposes and is a superior product from what is sold at the local super markets i am extremely pleased with the products quality indus organics delivered the cinnamon in a timely manner as well i will most likely order this product from them again ,1
the bags are great the designs are cute they are not quite as large or as soft as baggu bags but the price is much better also i am hoping the design does not peel ,1

if you are used to eating regular peanut butter like jif or peter pan this will probably not be palatable to you if you are used to eating natural pb then you will likely appreciate this product a bit more i bought this yesterday out of curiosity and it is quite delicious i love pb but try not to eat too much because it is so calorie dense i like to get my healthy fats through nut butters but some days you want to spend your calories on other foods this is great to put into a protein shake or smoothie without adding calories and i just had some on my lightened up french toast low cal bread egg whites sugar free syrup and it was delicious ,1
i am editing a previous review that i have to admit was negative about this great soup the first time i had this i really was not impressed but because i wanted more protein in my meal i added a can of clams which i did not properly drain it was watery and barely edible yesterday i decided that i had the cans yet to use so i opened a can just to get rid of it and after dumping the soup into the sausepan i could see that the consistency was wonderfully creamy with lots of potatoes and enough clams to be able to call it clam chowder i apologize to anyone who read my first review and chose not to purchase this wonderful soup i had a serving of this soup for lunch today i am on a plus or minue calories a day and i have made a commitment to stay this course for a year so far it has been days and my weight loss of pounds for a year old woman is pretty good this delicious soup will help make the next days easier thank you progresso ,1

i usually only buy freshly roasted beans from various online stores but bought these on a whim while ordering some other stuff from amazon when i received the beans i was immediately disappointed with the bag which did not appear to be vacuum sealed very tightly the date on the bag indicated something to the effect of sell by which tells me that these beans were probably roasted in june of it is now september which means these beans have been sitting in the bag for months with a less than ideal seal not good when i opened the bag and took a whiff the beans smelled okay but definitely did not have that rich chocolaty aroma that i am used to with freshly roasted beans the beans all have an even dark appearance with a mild oil sheen no burned charcoal in this bag which is good i had my first cup this morning and was less than thrilled with the brewing aroma it again lacked the richness that i am used to with my other blends the flavor can be described in the same way it is not bad at all but not particularly outstanding compared to the established household name brand beans that you can pick up in any grocery store cameron is organic french roast is a definite step up in flavor but it just can not compete with the roasted to order boutique blends if you can manage to get these beans freshly roasted and in a tight vacuum sealed bag where so much air has been sucked out that the beans all leave impressions in the side of the bag this may very well be an excellent coffee as it was shipped to me it is only fair edit spelling corrections i must have been half asleep when i typed this need more coffee it is worth noting that i ground up the entire bag and brought it to my workplace for my coworkers to use in the office coffee maker they are accustomed to drinking long oxidized grocery store purchased name brand coffee which i refer to as butt blend cameron is is a real treat for their defiled palates ,0
i grew up up in a family that loved mushrooms so i love using them in my cooking dried mushrooms are convenient because they keep so well i like the flavor of oyster mushrooms and jr mushrooms brand has an excellent quality to reconstitute them i put them in water and then put them into the microwave for minutes to get the water boiling then let them cool if some of them are still hard to cut i repeat the process on the ones that are still not soft then i cook with them like i would with fresh mushrooms they are easy to use in many different ways they taste great sauteed in butter i like adding them to stews or as ingredient for any sauce i make for cooking chicken i also found they go great with any indian sauce like pataks ,1
these are very handy when fresh fruit is not available i bought them for my month old and i to enjoy however they are a little too crunchy and sour for her to eat straight from the bag maybe some of other the other dried just fruit varieties are less tart overall they are nice to have on hand they lose some of their tartness when stirred in cereal or yogurt also good for baking ,1
it really does work but you have to keep drinking it it is very hard to cover the taste but i think if you are trying to get what is best for your baby the taste is worth it at least you can wash you mouth out when you are done ,1
i bought this item to get miso soup with less sodium imagine my surprise when it has more sodium than the regular kind of miso soup i do not think i will get it again ,0
this truly is awesome popcorn my favorite is the lemon sea salt but they are all good flavors i look forward to quinn developing more flavors in the future i burned my first batch so listen carefully to the popping when making your first bag to get your timing right my microwave cooks it in just under minutes but yours could take minutes the oil and flavoring packets are shaken into the bag after you finish popping the corn ,1
pamona is pectin was a late find for me after being frustrated for many years with the low sugar pectins still having tons of sugar and having problems gelling i have used this to make jam with alternative healthier sugars like agave nectar and they still came out great at first glance you might think that this quality of a pectin will run you more money and it would still be worth it but each box of pectin makes up to batches of jam this is so much more economical and easy to add just a bit more of pectin if you want a certain recipe a tad thicker they have great basic directions in the box and a very friendly and knowledgeable jam line to help with any other questions do not hesitate to give this one a try ,1
i have enjoyed mint tea both plain and mixed with black tea for many years i have to admit that this is probably the best one i have tried peppermint is sometimes too strong and spearmint too weak and musty but this particular peppermint is just right ,1

i initially ordered the pumpkin spice flavor i was not crazy about it very cinnamon heavy but customer service rep paul made a few great suggestions first if you are looking for a pumpkin flavor try the pumpkin pie syrup when i ordered pumpkin spice i was unaware that the pumpkin pie flavor existed i have now tried the pumpkin pie syrup and it is great also this syrup is not meant to be super sweet only sugar per full pump so you may want to add sugar sugar substitute even though the bottle suggests one and a half pumps for oz i tried pump and it was very good on a side note my interaction with paul was the best customer service i have ever experienced ,1
boylan is root beer is the finest drink of it is kind the pure cane sugar really makes an enormous difference in the taste unlike most others who use corn syrup this is exactly what happened to coke products when they changed to corn sweeteners it really lost something try a coke bottled in mexico or central america and you will see what i mean this fact along with boylan is excellent blend of flavorings makes their root beer the absolute best i give it a hearty two thumbs up ,1

i cannot find this soup locally and remember eating it a few times when i was younger i was very pleased to find it here in bulk i am very busy and also do not spend a lot of time on meals could be because i am single and like to make something fast first mistake i made when making first cup was just adding mix to water and stirring it a bit and thinking the clumps would even out not the case it requires water so i now add the mix to my cup get a small whisk out to smooth it then add the water and use the whisk again comes out with no clumps now i usually add a ton of saltines to it and stay full for hours i love this soup and am amazed at how much i am eating it as a meal it is also very nice to have something warm when it is cold outside you will not regret this buy great value ,1

pickles like these can be very much an acquired taste but once acquired that taste can amount to an addiction or even an obsession these pickles can add an incredible depth and complexity to almost any dish the one caveat concerns salt if you are on a salt restricted diet as many people with cardiac problems are these kinds of condiments pose obvious risks and take exceptional care to use safely i spoke from memory and inaccurately in a late evauation of deep is hot mango chutney so let me correct that here tablespoons contain mg sodium while priya mixed pickles in the same amount contain priya is are praised as absolutely authentic all over the web but i actually prefer these ,1
i was excited to get the ginger jerky in the mail after the good reviews but i find it very bland the jerky by vegan dreams is much better this has no taste and am pretty bummed i have packs i am never going to eat ,0
unless you are a die hard chocolate fan i would not recommend this product even then it is just way too overdone in the flavor department it takes like a old candy bar that is been sitting around for years covered with sawdust and protein powder and then frozen i have tried almost all of the arctic zero flavors and it is definitely the one that tastes the most like chemicals chocolate flavored chemicals but chemicals nonetheless on a positive note it is still better tasting than protein shakes i have had that have the same nutritional value but that is not saying much if you are looking to try arctic zero for the first time head over to maple vanilla it passes for frozen yogurt without a problem and has an awesome taste ,0
i used to drink folgers hazelnut coffee which i mixed with regular because the hazelnut flavor was so strong over the years the folgers coffee became wimpier and wimpier until i had to mix it and i recently found a bag of the kona joe hazelnut at a local department store and it has that strong flavor i used to love i will definitely be buying more of this the amazon com price is very good for the three pack even better with the free shipping ,1
although my kids prefer pop tarts this is a healthy alternative believe it or not the apple without the frosting is pretty decent there is cinnamon on the top of it which adds a bit of spice i do not really like too much frosting on mine the cherry pomengrante is the most preferred in my home they do not last as long as opposed to the blueberry strawberry is delicious too they travel pretty well too do not crumble too much ,1
i really enjoy this drink made with warmed milk in the cold months or blended with milk and ice cubes when the weather is hot it has a more mild flavor than the original spiced chai it saves me money when i can buy the bags of mix from amazon instead of paying a cup at the local espresso shop ,1
after buying coconut chips at trader joe is and loving them i had to find more i do not live near a trader joe is found these on amazon and hoped they would be the same kind of product was excited to find out they are they are basically shaved pieces of coconut that are baked roasted ingredients listed on the bag are fresh coconuts sugar and salt they are delicious and have the perfect crunch as a bonus they are a natural treat i eat them as a snack all by themselves my toddler loves them too the six pack will last us quite a while ,1
if you like to chew on gum that goes flat within minutes and transforms into a hard flavorless lump then this gum is for you it deserves no stars yet this was not an option ,0
i have been buying this coffee for a couple years and love it recently i started buying from amazon for convenience one thing that i have noticed is one week i will get a package that was roasted january the next order will be january and then the next order received march was roasted on january since this is ground coffee some people would say we have crossed the line on freshness the coffee is still great but shipping first in first out is something to strive for on items that have shelf lives adding to my review i just received my april shipment of two bags of black cat one bag has a roast date of and the other was roasted on based on this new information it is clear that amazon has no system to ship based on first in first out or they are buying spot market unsold coffee to sell at full retail price in a venue they call grocery gourmet food i love amazon so it concerns me that they cannot manage something as simple as grocery gourmet food my next stop is intelligentsia to see what they think about ground coffee that is roasted in january and sold to become a cup of coffee in may one more addition i finally got the answer the coffee is roasted for espresso when it passes the acceptable date to be ground for a good espresso they grind it for drip and sell it via amazon ,0
the product shipped to me in great time and the rice is so delicious i have already made pots of different types of risorto i would absolutely purchase when i run out ,1
ronzoni is ziti pasta makes for an easy dish to cook when you want a hot meal without a lot of fuss it can also be the main ingredient for a meal that has pasta with sauce as part of a main course dish the pasta remains quite fresh until any expiration date that is printed on the box and each box contains enough ziti for eight servings the pasta is so easy to cook just boil a pot of water pour in the amount of the ziti that you need and stir for about minutes if you like your pasta a bit firm then cook it for about minutes watch it and take a taste test of just one piece of pasta if you have any doubts some people add a little salt while the pasta cooks i personally do not add salt i never noticed any difference between salted and unsalted because the small amount of salt that you are supposed to add makes no big difference the pasta is very low in fat and it contains no trans fats thank goodness this pasta contains no cholesterol and no sodium either that is very good health news it does contain carbohydrates as you may have suspected but a single serving still keeps those carbs low at only of the daily allowance of carbs great ronzoni states on the front of the box that this macaroni pasta is enriched i assume they are referring to the iron niacin and riboflavin in the pasta the pasta has grams of protein per serving as well in addition this product is kosher if that matters to you there are some caveats however this product contains wheat and it is made in a facility that uses eggs if this is a concern for you please consult your doctor or nutritional expert have further questions no problem just call ronzoni using their toll free number or visit their website overall this ziti by ronzoni is the best out there it is affordable easy to cook and serve and it does not pose any major health risks to the vast majority of people i highly recommend this fine pasta ,1
my month old mix lab retriever chester mateo has tried beef turkey and lamb salmon and i just bought chicken lamb he just loved the previous ones they come pretty big for him so i cut it in pieces which comes out extremely small but i m training him with this so i give him many pieces during the day i don t want to fatten him up lol all i have to say is that the moment he sees me reaching for his treats he goes crazy sometimes it s hard to train him because he just wants me to give him the treats lol the good thing is that when i m training him outside he doesn t get distracted because he wants the treats more than exploring once he tries the chicken lamb i ll let you know how it goes lol,1
the tea is weak without the slightest hint of bergamot scent or taste even if it were plain black tea it is of inferior quality they make a big deal of their organic wholesome green image it is all fancy marketing and packaging i paid for a box of bags at a drugstore i truly feel gypped ,0
i got these for my husband who is a gummi fanatic they are very tough and chewy and do have an unusual flavor think sour chewing gum flavors but overall we were extremely satisfied ,1
i am a huge fan of ginger snaps when recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten free and recently pregnant i have been on the hunt for gf ginger snaps i have tried three mi del gluten free ginger snapsannie is homegrown ginger snap gluten free bunny cookiesmary is gone crackers love cookies gluten free ginger mi deltexture a bit grainy crunchy but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten free grainy way that is not my favorite textureginger flavor middling a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too muchsweetness sweet like you would expect a cookie to besize about inches and about inch thickdensity the most heavy or dense of the threeoverall or out of annie istexture a bit grainy but less so than mi del very crunchy little goldfish sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking ginger flavor the most mild of the three has that gingery hint to it but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tonguesweetness mild less sweet than mi del more like eating an animal cracker than cookie tastes great with a slice of cheese size about inch to inch and very thindensity lightoverall out of stars if you wanted a kid friendly cracker like snack this would be of mary istexture very crunchy not at all grainy texture was the least gluten free like of the three felt like i was eating a regular cookie ginger flavor very spicy i could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break but i am not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side i actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though plus it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes bonus sweetness not as sweet as mi del but not as mild as annie is very pleasant to me size about inches and about inch thick basically the same as mi del density ultra light most airy in the centeroverall out of stars everyone is tastebuds are different but these were my perceptions i personally want a ginger cookie with a good bite to it and i really can not stand gluten free products that are grainy in texture which seems to be most of them i want the texture to act like a regular gluten item for me mary is fit the bill exactly and annie is was a close second annie is was so different though i would eat mary is as a cookie and annie is as a snack so i could see having them both in the pantry the one i still want to try is pamela is because it has great amazon reviews i just do not want to buy them in bulk until i try them so i need to find them locally ,1

green tea is suppose to be the best tea for you i have tried many and just did not like them at all then i tried republic of tea matcha tea expensive but pretty good wheni brewed it with a black tea bag as well but i figured i was getting the green tea in there so better that way than not at all i decided to check amazon to see if i could get that tea cheaper and it is there that i found the reviews for this tea i just got the box this week and i am so happy i do not need to brew the black tea with it it is good very good and a lot cheaper than republic of tea the price of this tea seems to fluctuate though it has actually dropped in price since i ordered it days ago by wonder why ,1
the product is great and i like the specific brand i would like to know if they sell it in larger quantities ,1
i switched to fromm gold earlier this year from innova small bites i have two dogs a year old chinese crested powder puff and a year old yorkie bichon frise mix while they did very well on the innova as it also did not contain corn or wheat i was not thrilled that it was bought out by proctor gamble last year and fear it will go the way of other small brands that used to be higher quality like iams fromm gold was an easy switch over with no tummy issues for either dog they eat less which is something i try to watch carefully since they are both toy breeds and can tend to become overweight quickly and because they eat less and this food does not have all the fillers they poop less i add just a little bit of warm water to the kibble and they love their fromm gold crunchies and gravy their coats skin eyes and teeth are healthy and they have plenty of energy ,1
these are so hard to find but they taste wonderful not too hot not too mild i love keeping these in the car ,1
ferrarra pan red hots are just what red hots are meant to be the small individual boxes allow me to control myself and recognize when i have had enough large plastic bag is not a good idea for small little candies you just keep eating ,1
 ever since we used to get nibs back in the when they were darn near hard as rocks it was a family treat for long trips so black licorice is comfort food to me while tubi is tire treat is not hard as a rock it is at least chewy and i love the flavor i recommend it ,1

i bought a case of these before christmas on a off promotion i gave away a few cans as stocking stuffers but mostly we just ate them wonderful this is a very reliable brand perfectly tender and fresh the very large size is the perfect size for my escargot dishes and would also fit perfectly in smaller white mushroom caps i have kept my leftover snail butter butter shallots garlic parsely and cognac in the frig and we will enjoy another can of these for valentines day with a fresh baguette try them you will not be disappointed and your guests will be blown away a whole case of these could be less than you would pay for the same old same old cheese cold cuts and chips for a single party plan on six snails per person very rich ,1
the basic problem with this product is that unless you load a very small amount of coffee in the filter the filter clogs this causes the coffee ground and hot water to back up through the hole in the top and cause a mess my son and i spent a few hours experimenting with different ways to prevent this but we have admitted defeat i suspected the filter but i used filters which work perfectly fine in my ez cup still result in a mess on my kitchen counter even worse coffee grounds in my coffee however if you like your coffee very weak this will work well for you i hope they can fix the design issues until then i will stick with my ez cup ,0
this is a great flavor and a great way to introduce spices i can not get over how awesome these squeeze pouches are ,1
my year old mother remembers her mother making gooseberry jam in southern ohio she said this product tasted great just like she remembered it i liked it too this was my first tasting of the jam it was well packaged and shipped quickly too ,1
after making several batches using different techniques i can only get of the kernels to pop i used a different brand of kernels with much better results the only conclusion i can come to is that these packages are stale it does not help that there is no expiration or manufacture date listed anywhere on the packages i would recommend to not buy this product ,0
if you are a pet parent who loves giving your dog a delicious and good for you treat look no further than the treats from three dog bakery not only are these cookies free of all of the refined sugar and high fructose corn syrup chemicals artificial this and that by products and animal parts found in the majority of supermarket and chain pet store dog treats they are over the top yummy my only objection is the use of canola oil i would much rather see them use coconut oil i taste everything i feed my dog weird but true and these vanilla cookies actually taste like people snacks ,1
a little while back i was given a box of whole young coconuts to enjoy after a bit of practice i perfected the art of chopping the top open with a butcher is cleaver to insert a straw and suckle the sweet nectar contained within as much fun as that was whole coconuts take up too much space in the fridge and i am always concerned that they must use some kind of chemicals on them to keep the fresh from their home in thailand to my grocer is refrigerators without knowing really anything about the whole packaged coconut water game i assumed very incorrectly that i could just select a container of any random brand off a store shelf and it would taste as immaculate as the perfect juice from a fresh cracked coconut i could not have been more wrong i first tried vita coco because it seems to be the most common brand really everywhere it was even at costco so i bought their handy expecting to delight in the treat i got the tetra pak all nice and chilled before taking my first sip and when i did i was furious how can they call this coconut water i exclaimed it tastes kind of like diluted sour used soapy dish water that leaves a funky wang in your mouth and does nothing toward quenching your thirst it seemed to make me thirsty for some plain old water yuck at first i thought maybe i got a bad batch but then i headed online for some reviews and i found i was not alone how unfortunate however i also found lots of reviews of some other brands that people seemed to love yay there is still hope i thought to myself the confusing part was that for every brand for which i found good reviews there seemed to be countless other reviewers disgusted by each one i read a review comparing zico o n e and vita coco to one another and it ranked the former two far above the latter i went ahead and bought a bottle of each zico and o n e and determined they are swill especially zico which tastes like tap water that was spit into by someone who just ate a rotten coconut i continued reading reviews and found several stating that amy brian is really great but that some find it overly sweet i am not a fan of sugary sweetness in my coconut water but i thought i would give it a try anyway the results meh it is really not sweet at all and although there is more flavor it still does not taste like fresh coconut water yet another review stated that nature factor was a close second behind amy brian so i gave that a shot it is definitely a little worse than amy brian but it is very similar and does not taste like a real coconut i was just about to give up hope when one of the small oz bottles with pulp of taste nirvana landed in my hands i presumed it was going to be more funky wang sauce but i took my first sip and whoa ho hoooo what have we here a miracle in a bottle a fresh coconut shaped like a bottle nay it was really bottle coconut water that really tasted like coconut water in fact it tastes even better than fresh coconut water because there is a subtle sort of butteriness to the flavor i thought it had to be a fluke but i took another sip and about finished the bottle and every drop went down as unbelievably delicious as the first i immediately hopped onto amazon and started a subscribe save subscription my first case of these oz tall cans sans pulp arrived today and after a quick hour in the freezer i just tried my first can son of a biscuit it almost brings me to tears to tell you this but it was possibly the best canned beverage i have ever guzzled i tried so hard to make it last but i almost chugged the darned thing because the deliciousness was so unstoppable in short if you are looking for some good coconut water and do not want to deal with cleaving real coconuts save yourself a lot of time and heartache do not try anything but taste nirvana you will not regret it i just wish i had someone else giving me this advice at the start of my misadventures in coco hunting ,1
i was worried about them tasting like burnt bananas like other reviewers but we did not have a problem my two daughters are pretty picky about flavors and consistencies but they both enjoyed the banana chocolate chip chewy bar they have a nice banana flavor without the fake taste that i hate so much there are little pieces of oatmeal on top and inside there is something that gives a tiny crunch makes me think of rice krispies i compared them to the other chewy bars we have on hand kashi tlc cascadian farm and kellogg is and they have very similar nutritional values the only thing all my other boxes have six bars and the banana chocolate chip came with only five something to think about when comparing prices is the quantity of bars in the box ,1
looks like the real thing plenty of room to hide some jewelry and loose cash tucked in a one of the door shelves of my refrigerator no one the wiser great product ,1
so i am trying to lose a few pounds and i am eating a lot of vegetables steam em and sprinkle some of this stuff on em and all of a sudden they are tasty amazing ,1
disgusting rancid and unreturnable food product do not buy horrible gross don t waste your money or your time made in tiawan i threw my whole order in the trash ,0
the summary my daughter likes the taste the small size minimizes waste and makes it easy to travel with but it is relatively expensive compared with powders and larger bottles the bottles are a perfect amount for a supplement you can easily use more bottles but the amount helps minimize waste this is an expensive way to buy formula if you are feeding formula exclusively but it is great if you just need it for traveling or to notop up your baby when he she does not get enough from breastfeeding in theory you can add a nipple and ring and feed your baby directly from the bottle but i tend to use baby bottles that help reduce the amount your baby swallows i use born free because it is also bpa free also the small bottles fit easily in the side of a diaper bag most bags will hold in a side pocket my daughter seems to like the taste she is primarily breastfed and has no problem getting breastmilk sometimes and this formula sometimes i do notice that it tends to stain my daughters clothing but i do not know if that is unique to this brand or common to all formulas ,1
i recieved the navitis cocao power it came in the form of a powder and it was very rich and very fine and it dissolves quite well in liquid i like the flavor very much ican tell it comes from the criollo variety i like to use it in my french press coffee mug it makes a very rich ice cold alternatives to coffee the good thing about it is it so fine that you can even steep it cold water so you can keep all of the nutrients instead of heating up sure it is a little bit expensive but a little bit goes a long way i just use a teaspoon in a ounce glass of water and is flavors of very well i am very happy with this product i would recommend it to anyone it is also good in baked goods ,1
exactly as i expected it to be bought this item as a gift and the recipient was pleased with it ,1
my kids go through these at an alarming pace buying them at the grocery store would break the bank but amazon makes it affordable use the auto deliver to get it even cheaper ,1
i bought this product uncertain that it would be worth the money and quickly came to love it i made gf biscuits and gravy for my family and we did not mention that it was all gluten free everyone loved the biscuits they did not fall apart at all like a lot of other brands do i used butter flavored shortening and i think it made the biscuits even more delicious if you have not tried it yet try it now i now buy a box a week amazon has a much better price than i can find in most stores in vegas ,1
i love smucker is natural creamy peanut butter i used to buy them at the store but for me being a big peanut butter fan and using so much of it so often that i found it a better to deal to buy it in bulk because i go threw it so often smucker is has great taste and is smooth and healthy for you being the natural kind and being a fitness nutrition health and bodybuilder this is important to me ,1
while the timeliness of the item is arrival was great and the cans where well packaged i was disappointed in the handling of the shipment by shipment personnel as i unpacked the cans i noticed there was a dent on of them and i mean a massive dent per can which seemed like a result of an intentional kick but i commend the seller for having the cans still in the plastic and all grouped together prior to being packaged by the shipper great deal price product too ,1
super mild coffee little taste little aroma when i think of this coffee i am underwhelmed to say the most nuff words are a lot when you are trying to be nice ,0

i love british groceries so i decided to try this mustard after reading many fav reviews i was surprised how it is similar to japanese karashi or mustard it has the same kick to it and i could not tell the difference between i know japan got a lot of influence from the uk more than the us in the past especially in terms of adapting westernized dishes but i never thought this is to be just like karashi this is for those who can stand the heat this mustard makes regular yellow mustard so lame no offence love it ,1
i sent feedback product was fine but i recieved very dented cans and one that was busted open did not recieve apply from my feedback ,1

i am allergic to walnuts and almonds and i love granola unfortunately for me this means i can not really eat granola because almonds are usually the second ingredients in granola but then i found this granola it is sweet delicious full of raisins and nary an almond to be found it is as the other reviewer pointed out a little dry but i always eat mine with yogurt or milk so until she pointed out the fact that it is dry it did not really occur to me bottom line this stuff is amazing and,1
my puppy just could not take these treats or the grain free dog food it just was not for him he was having a lot of digestions problems which went away as soon as we stopped giving him these treats make your own treats if you have the time my dog prefers our homemade treats plus there are no added preservatives and you will know how long they have been sitting around good luck ,0

this product is great to use if you want to deep condition your hair and scalp with it i used the coconut oil along with the suave professional hair conditioner put a plastic cap on my head and sat under the hair dryer for thirty minutes with the hair dryer on the low setting and noticed that my hair was much softer and easier to manage i have been natural for about a year and six months or longer without a perm in my hair since i noticed a difference in my hair i wanted to make sure that my hair was softer because of the coconut oil because i had just started using the suave professional conditioner so when it was time to shampoo my hair again i put the same conditioner on my hair sat under the hair dryer for thirty minutes with the setting on low as usual without the coconut oil on my hair and noticed that my hair was not as soft as when i used the coconut oil on my hair in addition to the conditioner my hair was still soft not to imply that suave professional is not a good conditioner and did not make my hair soft however my hair seemed much softer when i used the coconut oil and the conditioner on my hair it is also great to use on the scalp as well usually when i grease my scalp with sulfur fresh hair scalp conditioner in the yellow jar with the blue cap after washing and conditioning my hair within three to four days i wash and grease my hair again because my scalp no longer feels clean since i started greasing my scalp with the coconut oil first just a very little on the scalp area then put the sulfur fresh hair and conditioner on my scalp on the same scalp area where i put the coconut oil my scalp feels healthier after only two treatments of greasing my hair with the coconut oil and sulfur i am assuming that using the coconut oil with any conditioner and any hair grease will make the hair and scalp feel healthier softer and easier to manage i highly recommend using this product or any other coconut oil if you want to use the product to help with the conditioning of your hair and or scalp ,1

i started using holistic select when i got an english mastiff puppy because it was well recommended by a number of breeders georgia the puppy did so well on their food i decided two years ago to try the senior food for our elderly golden retriever soccer had been on purina dog chow all his life he was really starting to act and show his age he was overweight slowing down and getting gimpy from laying around too much what a difference now he is much more trim playful again and actually runs around the yard at the only difference has been the change in food so i give holistic select complete credit for this remarkable transformation i discovered that i could buy holistic select products from amazon about a year ago their price is a few bucks cheaper than the pet stores where i was buying and delivery is free since i live in a rural county this saves me driving to the big city to get their dog food having it delivered makes my life much easier ,1

after finding out what splenda is and contains i have made it clear to my family and friends to keep away from this product splenda is not natural it is a chlorinated artificial sweetener there have been no long term human studies on the safety of splenda however issues have been raised about splenda in a new study from duke university in animals examined for the study splenda reduced the amount of good bacteria in the intestines by percent increased the ph level in the intestines contributed to increases in body weight and affected p glycoprotein p gp levels in such a way that crucial health related drugs could be rejected the p gp effect could result in medications used in chemotherapy aids treatment and treatments for heart conditions being shunted back into the intestines rather than being absorbed by the body i would suggest anybody who seriously cares for his her health to stay away from splenda and try stevia or brown sugar if you must use a sweetener ,0
i am a huge fan of better oats and am working through all of their flavors at first i did not like this one because it is not exactly like strawberries as i ate it though i decided it tasted kinda like crunchberries and that made it fantastic i also like the low sugar content the convenient measuring pouch and the environmentally thoughtful design ,1
